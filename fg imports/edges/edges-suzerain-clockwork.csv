Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Aos sidhe/Shining Ones","Agility d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>All aos sidhe start play with the Edges and Hindrances below.</p><p>Edge: Connections. This can be due to the great houses’ patronage of others or just people your adventurer used his position to help. Whatever the reason, your adventurer starts with the Connections Edge for a group of your choice for free.</p><p>Hindrance: Realm Bound. Your adventurer finds it physically traumatic visiting the mortal realms from Mechadia. He suffers 2 levels of Fatigue when first going through one of the portals that dot the landscape, visiting via dreams or even when getting swept away by a dreamstorm. Interestingly, he doesn’t have any such problems when crossing the Veil as a Heroic character, using the normal method most Suzerain heroes use (see</p><p>Savage Suzerain for more on that). It must be something about Mechadia itself.Hindrance: Iron Allergy (minor). As an aos sidhe your adventurer is closer linked to the fey of the Fey Realm of Dreams than most, and suffers their traditional allergy to iron. If you want, you can choose to upgrade this to a major Hindrance at character creation - it will count as if you’d taken a new minor Hindrance instead.</p><p>Upon choosing to be an aos sidhe, you also need to choose which one of the twelve great houses your adventurer is from. Each adds its own special abilities (for good and bad) to your character.</p>"
"Boggarts","Spirit d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Boggarts are squat, hairy, often smelly ruffians who stand about three feet tall. They typically have olive-toned skin and are largely covered in matted brown or black hair. They also don’t have noses, just a pair of nostril slits (and they absolutely despise people with large noses). They enjoy playing pranks, such as setting elaborate traps, turning invisible and waiting to watch what befalls their next victim. They like to tempt other fey to the darker side of things – drugs, pranks that often go too far, political backstabbing, etc.</p><p>Boggarts find destruction hilarious (both physical and psychological destruction; they like to see their pretty fey brethren fail). If it blows up, a boggart will think it’s funny, even if what blows up is his own house. He probably needed to move out of that filthy place anyway.</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Invisibility: Boggarts have the ability to spend Pulse to turn themselves invisible as per the Power, but they can ignore the Rank requirement. The Power always succeeds, but never gets a Raise.</p><p>• Destroy Machinery: Your adventurer can spend an action in contact with a machine and 2 Pulse to make a Spirit check. If this check is passed he breaks the machine completely. It requires a successful Repair check and at least 20 minutes work to fix this. Anyone finding the broken machine within 5 minutes of it being damaged will recognize the smell of boggart magic.</p><p>• Squat And Hairy: Boggarts suffer -1 Charisma.</p><p>• Persuasive: When trying to get other fey to do them a favor, boggarts get a +1 Charisma bonus which cancels out their natural -1.</p><p>• Racist: Boggarts start with the Hindrance Racist: Brownie (minor).</p><p>• Small: Due to the boggart’s small frame they suffer -1 Toughness.</p>"
"Gremians","Agility d6, Invention d4, Repair d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Gremians are the stuff that dreams are made of – literally. When a creative mind is so obsessed with inventive ideas that they manifest in dreams, sometimes the ideas in these dreams are so powerful that they give birth to new life in the realm of Mechadia. This is how gremians are born. The gremian that is hatched from the dream grows into a conglomerate of inventor and invention – for example, the gremian who sprang from Samuel Morse’s dream of the electrical telegraph looks like a little human with wooden skin, twisted wiry hair and a clipped, clicky manner of talking.</p><p>The gremians are curious about technology first and foremost, throwing their lives into the everspinninggears of experimentation. They revere the goblins, who are talented engineers and architects, but often look down on other fey races like pixies and pooka who are not as technologically adept.</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Tool Hands: Gremians always count as having the correct tools for Invention or Repair work. They can also use them as natural weapons doing Damage: Str+d4.</p><p>• Tech-Shift: Gremians love technology so much that they can spend Pulse to move near it instantaneously. By spending 3 Pulse a gremian can teleport himself up to 10” as long as he appears within 1” of a significant piece of technology or machinery. Significant can be roughly categorized as being immovable by hand, but your GM has the final say. All his gear travels with him but he can’t take other people or creatures.</p><p>• Builders: Gremians gain +2 on Invention and Repair rolls.</p><p>• Idle Hands: Gremians start with the Hindrance Habit: Projects (major).</p>"
"Pixie","Pixie","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Pixies are winged green fey standing only about a foot tall. Pixies are fascinated with all modes of storytelling, particularly theatre and film because those are more immediate and immersive.</p><p>Overall, pixies don’t enjoy strutting their peacock feathers around court, although they do still compete for the attention of wealthy benefactors. After all, the arts need financial backing to survive. Pixie actors are among the finest in the realm, and pixie technicians produce wonderful magical special effects – fireworks, lighting, acoustics, music, and images. Their ability to create illusions (visual, auditory, even olfactory) aids them in all their productions.</p><p>Pixies also find regular employment as communications experts (in both civilian and military roles). They’re interested in true stories as well as fiction, so many pixies are journalists. And with the recent rise of tension between continents over the matter of having a single ruler of Mechadia, more and more pixies are finding themselves approached in shadowy halls and asked to spin a news story a certain way, for a special friend….</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Fly: A pixie’s normal form of movement is flight: Pace is 8 with a Climb of 4, and the running dice is a d8. On the ground, his Pace is 2.</p><p>• Nippy: Pixie Agility starts at d6.</p><p>• Illusions: Pixies are able to create illusions out of Pulse, exactly as the Piaras aos sidhe do (see above).</p><p>• Pixie Dust: This ability costs 2 Pulse and affects everyone within a Small Burst Template, friend or foe. It requires a Shooting roll (target number 4) and has a range of 8”. If successful you roll a d8 and consult this chart:</p><p>1) Everyone in range sneezes repeatedly. -1 to next action.</p><p>2) Everyone in range takes Damage: 1d6.</p><p>3) Everyone in range receives the Hindrance Hard of Hearing for 1d6 Rounds.</p><p>4) The casting pixie teleports 1d6 inches directly towards or directly away from the target area (his choice).</p><p>5) Everyone in range takes Damage: 2d6.</p><p>6) Everyone in range receives the Hindrance Blind for 1d4 Rounds.</p><p>7) Everyone in range teleports 1d6 inches in random directions.</p><p>8) The casting pixie gets to choose the result from this list.</p><p>Pixie Dust Roll Table</p><p/><p>• If the pixie is about to be caught in the area of effect, and doesn’t like what’s about to happen to him, as a reflexive action he may teleport 1d8 inches in a random direction.</p><p>• Very Small: Pixies are such small creatures they incur a -2 Toughness penalty.</p><p>• Weak And Feeble: Increasing pixie Strength and Vigor at character creation costs 2 points rather than 1.</p><p>• Wants To Be Liked: Pixies really, really want to be liked and will suck up massively to try and get people to like them. However, they usually overdo it and if the target passes a Smarts roll they cotton on and the pixie suffers -2 to all social interaction with them.</p>"
"Pooka","Spirit d6, Survival d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>In their bipedal form, pooka are cuddly charmers with exaggerated features (long-noses, wide-mouths, ears that are longer and higher set on their heads than the other fey). They stand about five feet tall. Each pooka is born with the ability to change into one animal (mammal, bird, fish, reptile, etc.), and when the pooka is in fey form, he retains some characteristics of his animal form (mammal pooka might have hair the same color as the animal they change into, a fish pooka might have glassy eyes, and so on).</p><p>Pooka have an affinity with nature, and occasionally spend long stretches of time in the wild in alternative forms. But the cuddly nature-lover demeanor sits side by side with their daredevil, speed junkie culture with its pervading go-big-or-go-home mentality.</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Animal Form: At character creation pooka need to choose their natural animal form. At any time as an action they can shift into this animal form or back.</p><p>• Shifter: Pooka can spend 1 Pulse to shift into different animals of roughly the same mass. They can spend 2 Pulse to increase or decrease their size rating, minimum -2 maximum +2.</p><p>• Impulsive: When presented with an opportunity for big thrills or a challenge, pooka must pass a Spirit roll to not get involved.</p>"
"Regeneration","Seasoned, Vigor d8+, Troll","Edge - General","<p>As per normal Slow Regeneration rules in the Savage Worlds rulebook.</p>"
"Spriggans","Vigor d8","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Spriggans can be nasty little fey, and telling them so will only make them chuckle – or pull your eyebrows off. Or both. Their natural form is gnarled, like a tree in winter, rarely exceeding four and a half feet tall with wide, slanted yellow eyes and catlike pupils, scaly, almost bark-like grey-brown skin and spiny, branchlike protrusions in place of hair. They’re dour and pessimistic on the whole (they would argue that they’re being ‘realistic’).</p><p>When angered, frightened or whenever they just feel like picking a fight, spriggans can ‘puff up’ for a limited time, up to four times their regular size. The effect lasts for one scene and wears off when the danger has passed or when the spriggan is exhausted (whichever comes first).</p><p>Contrary to this overall violent lifestyle, spriggans have an inexplicable love of tea. Some spriggan battles have even been known to halt abruptly at tea time, resuming the action once everyone has finished their last biscuit or scone.</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Grow: By paying 2 Pulse spriggans can increase their size to that of an elf, for 3 Pulse they can grow to the size of a small troll. At elf size they gain +1 Toughness, at troll size they gain +2 Toughness. This growth lasts 6 Rounds, till they are knocked unconscious, or they decide to deflate.</p><p>• Agile: Spriggans start with Agility d6.</p><p>• Strong: Spriggans also start with Strength d6.</p><p>• Fighter: If a spriggan wishes to stop fighting or wishes to avoid starting a fight if provoked, they need to pass a Smarts -2 roll.</p><p>• Oath: If a spriggan gives someone their word and then breaks it they suffer 1 point of Fatigue that takes 24 hours to clear.</p><p>• Small: Due to a spriggan’s small frame he suffers -1 Toughness.</p>"
"Trolls","Troll","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>These subterranean laborers are seven to nine feet tall, and their bodies vary from whip-thin, spindly limbed slinkers to stocky walls of muscle with arms and legs as thick as cooking pots. Their knobbly skin (which can range in color from grey-green to arctic blue) reacts poorly to sunlight, always blistering and sometimes smoldering upon direct contact, hence their desire to remain underground, only coming up at night for supplies or a moment’s escape from their subterranean toils.</p><p>Almost all trolls work in the Great Underground, maintaining the massive system of gears that runs the continents of Mechadia and maintains the creature comforts of the surface folk. Many fey have never seen a troll in the flesh and grow up thinking of them as an old wives’ tale, something to scare children into coming home at curfew.</p><p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Strong Mechanic: Trolls can spend 1 Pulse to double their Strength for the sake of performing mechanical work and repairs. This can’t be used in combat or general Strength checks.</p><p>• Resistance: Any damage a troll takes from steam, fire or electricity is halved after the dice have been rolled. In the case of a flaming arrow, the arrow would still do normal damage but the extra flaming damage would be halved.</p><p>• Spit Goo: Trolls gain +2 on Repair rolls due to their glue-like saliva.</p><p>• Size +1: Trolls are larger than average fey; this means they gain +1 Toughness. They also start with Strength d6.</p><p>• Troll: Trolls suffer -1 Charisma.</p><p>• Sunburn: If a troll is exposed to bright sunlight for more than 10 minutes unprotected he suffers a Wound, and one every 10 minutes after that while in the sun. A cloudy day or some protection means reduces this to a Wound every hour rather than every 10 minutes. If they wear a significant level of protection, for example covering clothes, hat, umbrella and sun screen, they only suffer a -1 to all actions in sunlight.</p><p>• Looked Down On: Trolls suffer-2 on social interaction checks with average non-troll, nongiant fey. Your GM may waive this penalty if the fey in question has any understanding or compassion towards trolls.</p><p>• Language: Trolls know the language ‘Troll’, as well as the common Mechadian language. This language is largely unknown outside of troll and giant communities.</p>"
