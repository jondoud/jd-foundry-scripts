"Cybershaman","","Edge - Arcane Background","<p>Arcane Skill: Cyberitual (Spirit)</p><p>Starting Powers: summon ally + 2. Cybershamans bind spirits with their prepared code and later invoke the spirit program for magical effects. Your hero starts with the summon ally Power, specifically for manifesting bound spirits into the physical world, plus two other Powers. These are rituals your cybershaman keeps prepared at all times, ready to trigger.</p><p>At the heart of a cybershaman is the ability to bind spirits into magical or computer code to manifest later, and they may add the Mind Rider Modifier to summon ally for free. They may not, however, use the Glow/Shroud Modifier for any of their Powers. They may substitute the Cyberitual Skill for Hacking when infiltrating Pulse-powered data systems, which may be computers in Gatherall or magical scrolls, glyphs, and wards in another land, bypassing electronic or magical locks, and so on.</p><p>Activation: A cybershaman must be able to gesture (they cannot be Bound) to invoke their spirit programs.</p><p>Available Powers: arcane protection, banish,beast friend, confusion, detect/conceal arcana, dispel, divination, empathy, fear, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, puppet, slumber, speak language, stun, summon ally, warrior's gift.</p>"
"Technomage","","Edge - Arcane Background","<p>Arcane Skill: Technomancy (Smarts)</p><p>Starting Powers: 3</p><p>Technomages are surrounded by a cloud of nanobots, too small to see with the naked eye, which they control and fuel with Pulse to carry out their "spells". Is it magic? Is it technology? Yes, and yes. Gatherall Prime University's technomancy department specializes in matter manipulation and holographic projection.</p><p>Technomages may substitute the Technomancy Skill for Repair when working on Pulse-infused objects. (Note: this includes magic items from realms outside of Gatherall.)</p><p>For technomancers, the zombie spell is for animating constructs, bringing robotic forms to life for a period of time. You never know when you'll need an industrial load-lifter to crush that alien queen, and who wants to one moment?</p><p>Technomages may not use the Range Modifier for any of their Powers due to the limited range of their nanobots, which have to stay close to remain fuelled by your technomage's Pulse.</p><p>Activation: Technomages must be able to speak and gesture (they cannot be Bound) to activate their spells.</p><p>Available Powers: barrier, boost/lower trait, burrow, darksight, detect/conceal arcana, disguise, drain power, farsight, healing, illusion, invisibility, light/obscure, object reading, protection, sloth/speed, smite, wall walker, zombie.</p>"
