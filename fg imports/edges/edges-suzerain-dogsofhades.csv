"Iron Jaw","Novice, Vigor d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>This character gains +2 to Soak rolls.</p>"
"Logician","Novice, Smarts d10+, Vigor d6+","Edge - Perfected (as per Savage Suzerain)","<p>If a child is able to read before they can walk, and able to solve third degree equations before they are potty trained, then he might be a Logician. Traditionally on Athens, Logician children are bought from the parents at the age of eight or nine by the polis and sent to train on Thasos at the famous academy for Logicians. Wealthy or sentimental parents might keep the child, and raise it on their own, with all the problems that might incur due to their poor social skills. Contrary to common prejudice, every Logician is a unique individual with their own personality, though it might be difficult for some to see through the peculiarities that make them Logicians.</p><p>All Logicians share the following abilities and limitations:</p><p>EIDETIC MEMORY</p><p>The level of detail with which Logicians remember is such that it can hinder them functioning in society unless their abilities are properly trained and mastered. A normal person might be able to describe all the contents of a room he visited an hour ago. A Logician would be able to describe all contents of the room, down to the number of tiles in the floor. Unfortunately, such a level of detail sometimes clouds the mind of less-trained Logicians, so the GM may demand a Smarts check to remember something important other than the exact number of tiles in the floor. Sometimes the question is whether the Logician noticed a piece of information or a detail, in which case a Notice roll might be more relevant. This ability also gives the Logician the same ability as the Edge Jack-of-all-Trades.</p><p>PERFECT TIMING</p><p>This ability, though often overlooked, is perhaps the most supernatural. Logicians never lose track of time. Their internal biological watch is perfect down to the micro-second, far beyond what their physique is able to take advantage of. Since time is relative and can be affected by gravity and speed, the Logician sometimes needs to adjust his time to local conditions. This ability is not affected by the physical or the mental state of the Logician. In one famous instance, a Logician woke up after a five year coma, and was able to tell the date and time precisely! This ability is most important in connection with astronavigation, and can also been used as an important part of coordinating large scale maneuvers in battles. It can also be a natural alarm clock.</p><p>LIGHTNING CALCULATOR</p><p>This is the ability that has given Logicians their name. Systematic and logical thought is the very essence of Logicians, and nothing is more pure and systematic than basic mathematics. If the GM feels it is necessary to have the Logician make a roll to solve a mathematical problem it is done with a +4 bonus and is resolved instantaneously. Failure should be explained by a lack of facts or numbers, since keeping score of even billions of different numbers is child’s play to the Logician mind. Only higher levels of abstract mathematics or complicated statistics will sometimes distract a Logician, but they still get their +4 bonus.</p><p>NO SENSE OF HUMOR</p><p>The Logician gains the Hindrance of the same name. Note that two Logicians talking together do not suffer -2 Charisma towards each other due to this Hindrance, though they still can’t tell a decent joke.</p><p>TRUTHFUL</p><p>The Logician gains the Hindrance of the same name. Note that if the GM allows it, the Logician may “downgrade” this Hindrance to Big Mouth by using an Advance.</p><p>SOCIALLY INEPT</p><p>Logicians can never take the following skills: Taunt, Streetwise or Persuasion. Nor can they take any Edges which would require social skills or empathy, such as most Leadership Edges and many professional Edges. But that is a small price to pay for mental superiority, right?</p>"
"Logician Fighting","Novice, Logician","Edge - Combat","<p>Using their mental abilities to the fullest, some Logicians have developed remarkable fighting styles, limited only by the slowness of their flesh and bones. By calculating all movements and trajectories around them and figuring the odds, they can gain a significant advantage over others in combat. Logician Fighting changes the linked Attribute for Fighting, Shooting and Throwing to Smarts. If acquired after character creation, this Edge doesn’t change already existing Skills, only the future progress. As an extra benefit to Logician Fighting, your character may move or run while using the Defense or Full Defense options.</p>"
"Noble - Modified","Novice","Edge - Background","<p>There are so many nobles and people of noble bearing in the Garden of Athena that they’ve lost their luster a bit and have to work harder to impress those around them. There’s no +2 Charisma bonus for being Noble in this Suzerain realm (but if your character travels to another realm he may get that bonus back, for acting in a ‘noble way’).</p>"
"Thasoplis Academy","Novice, Logician","Edge - Background","<p>Your character was sent to the Logician training academy in Thasopolis, being taught by the greatest Logician minds. He gains the benefits of the Scholar Edge. In addition, he gains 2 Skill Points that can be used for Smarts-based Skills. However, the academy also instills a fervent loyalty in their students towards whoever paid for the education. The Logician gains the Sense of Duty Hindrance aimed towards his benefactor (usually his home polis). He can’t have the Excellent Gymnasium Edge – the academy replaces any normal education he would have had.</p>"
"Trademark Armor","Novice, Hoplite","Edge - Combat","<p>Sometimes a suit of armor is more than mere protection. Sometimes it is an heirloom, a piece of family history, or an ancient artifact from long ago. With this Edge your character’s Bio-Ceramic Hoplite Armor (and he needs to own such a suit before taking this Edge) is such a suit. The suit gives +1 to Soak rolls and +1 to recover from Shaken while wearing it. Suits start out as normal hoplite armor (+6 Armor), but the character may get it repaired and reinforced (paying the full price of the next “level” of armor).</p>"
