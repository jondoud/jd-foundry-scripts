Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Adept","Spirit d8+","Edge - Arcane Background","<p>Arcane Skill: The Way (Spirit)</p><p>Starting Powers: 3 (Disciplines)</p><p>Adepts are masters of the body and mind, tapping their own internal Pulse reserves to the maximum potential. Theirs is the power to know, and even change, thoughts. Their Powers are called “disciplines”. Adepts also have</p><p>Aura Sense: they are able to detect arcana at will, using their Spirit as a check. A Magic (Smarts) check is required to identify what type of magic is at work, and a Raise senses what Power is in effect, if any. Adepts gain a +2 to identify psionic Powers.</p><p>Activation: The Way is a taxing form of mystical power, and as such, adepts are trained to use focus crystals (carved from the mineral substance called crysarium) to offset the drain upon themselves. If an adept must use a discipline without their focus crystal, the Pulse cost is doubled. If an adept loses their focus crystal and must find another, or decides they would like to bond with another more powerful crystal it requires an Advance to do so.</p><p>Available Powers: <i>bolt, boost trait, confusion, deflection, disguise, dispel, object reading, protection, puppet, speed/sloth, smite, speak language, telekinesis, warrior’s gift.</i></p>"
"Druid","Spirit d8+","Edge - Arcane Background","<p>Arcane Skill: Channeling (Spirit)</p><p>Starting Powers: 2 (Gifts)</p><p>Druids are the living conduits of the power and will of the Ascended. They are no mere worshippers; they are partners with the Ascended, working to keep the Four Paths of Life (Nature, Earth, Sky, and Sea) strong and vital in the world. Druids automatically start with the Obligations (Major: Four Paths) Hindrance, and failure to follow the will of the Ascended or committing acts against Life could result in very harsh consequences. These can range from a temporary loss of Powers to even falling very ill (long-term Fatigue levels), depending on the egregiousness of the transgression (your GM is left to decide).</p><p>Their powers are called “gifts”. Druids also have Aura Sense: they are able to detect arcana at will, using their Spirit as a check. A Magic (Smarts) check is required to identify what type of magic is at work, and a Raise senses what Power is in effect, if any. Druids gain a +2 to identify powers of Life.</p><p>Activation: Based on the Path they channel, the druid must have access to it in some fashion. This means earth, stone or metal for Earth Gifts, some form of water for Sea Gifts, trees and plants for some Nature Gifts, and a decent amount of space for Sky Gifts. They must also be able to speak, invoking the names of the Ascended and other spirits to grant their desired gifts.</p><p>Available Powers: <i>banish, barrier, best friend, bolt, burrow, darksight, deflection, dispel, entangle, environmental protection, farsight, fly, growth/shrink, healing, protection, relief, summon ally, wall walker.</i></p>"
"Kalinata","Novice, Brinchie, Agility d8+, Strength d6+, Fighting d8+","Edge - Racial","<p>Those who are initially trained in the brinche martial art of kalinata learn tomaximize the effectiveness of their natural weapons; their claws do Str+d6 damage. As well, they move so fast and fluidly that Gang Up bonuses against them are reduced by one. This training also ensures that the wielder of the rrka gets +1 Parry regardless of whether or not it is used defensively.</p><p>Does not stack with Martial Artists.</p>"
"Mage","Seasoned, Sorcerer, Smarts d8+, Knowledge (Magic) d8+, Sorcery d6+","Edge","<p>The path of sorcery is a difficult one. Each practitioner struggles constantly to master the eldritch forces at their disposal. Some achieve a level of mastery that entitles them to be addressed as a mage. This confers the Wizard Edge on the sorcerer (renamed as the Mage Edge). In addition, he is no longer subject to the automatic wound effect for a "snake eyes" roll during casting, though he still suffers normal Backlash results.</p>"
"Shield Expertise","Seasoned, Agility d6+, Fighting d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>A character with Shield Expertise increases the Parry value of any shield (but not bracers) by +1. As well, the shield now provides full protection to the wielder’s front, both sides, and rear.</p>"
"South-Born","Human, special","Edge - Racial, background","<p>When the South-Born Edge is taken, your hero gains one of the following:</p><p>• One free Attribute raise (and that attribute – and linked Skills – now caps at d12+1 without needing Legendary Edges).</p><p>• +3 additional Skill points (when spending these, you can ignore linked Attributes).</p><p>• One Novice Racial Edge from any other race (but only with your GM’s permission).</p>"
"Surge","Heroic","Edge - Weird","<p>The blast doors are closing, the villain is escaping, the ground is crumbling beneath you. Just, a little, faster. Your muscles shriek, something surges within you. Jackpot!</p><p>Your character may increase his Pace by any amount for one round. Each inch of movement beyond normal costs 1 Pulse.</p>"
"Venerable","Eldakar, Smarts d8+","Edge - Racial, background","<p>Venerable eldakar ignore the -2 when making unskilled checks; they must still expend an Advance to acquire a skill before they can raise it past d4.</p>"
"Warrior-Adept Of The Jade Flame","Seasoned, Adept, Spirit d8+, Strength d6+, Vigor d6+, Fighting d8+, The Way d8+","Edge - Professional","<p>Warrior-Adepts can use the following disciplines as a free action (but they, may only activate one discipline with this ability per Round): <i>analyze foe, boost trait, deflection, protection, smite, speed, and warrior’s gift.</i></p><p>When casting as a free action, they may only affect themselves with the discipline; they can’t bestow the discipline on anyone else, as that requires a normal action.</p>"
