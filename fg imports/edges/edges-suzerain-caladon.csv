Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Crusader","Novice, Empowered, Faith d10+, Fighting d8+l","Edge - Professional","<p>The adventurer is a member of the Swords of Trinity – a holy order of warriors devoted to defending the Light of Trinity with both blade and prayer. A Sword of Trinity is trained to fight as he prays, and pray as he fights, so he may make an attack roll and invoke a prayer as part of the same Action. This means he can roll Fighting (or Shooting or Throwing) and Faith (or similar Empowered skill) at the same time. If he is a Wild Card, he also gets his Wild Die as normal, and may use it in place of one or the other Skill die results if necessary.</p>"
"Dryad","Novice, Agility d10+","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Dryads are walking plants – the elemental race of flora. Dryads are normally slight, with a faint green tinge to their skin, and are known for being remarkably agile. Their hair is made of living plants – either long grasses or vine-like dreadlocks. Both men and women are usually slightly shorter than normal humans of the same gender.</p><p>Communicate With Plants:</p><p>Dryads can talk telepathically with the plants around them, giving the plants temporary sentience if need be (plants which are already sentient, such as other dryads in integrated form, don't need this, but may still be talked to telepathically). Communicating with plants is an automatic action taking one minute of concentration and costing 1 Pulse. Dryads have the ability to telepathically communicate with any sentient plant they are touching, and the ability to increase the intellect of one non-sentient plant he is touching to a state of bare sentience – capable of language but not wit or deep thought. This lasts for one hour, and multiple uses of this action can run simultaneously, giving more than one plant sentience simultaneously. Sentient plants have the ability to recall their surroundings using a supernatural version of the five human senses, even for recent events that happened before gaining sentience (up to 24 hours before), but do not gain the ability to move any more than they could before.Integrate With Plants:</p><p>Dryads can pay Pulse to take on the spiritual signature of a plant. They can merge with any plant mass (one large tree or a tall stand of grasses) large enough to contain their body without the plant moving aside in any way. The dryad and the plant simply become one. This costs the dryad 3 Pulse for one Round and can be maintained at a cost of 1 additional Pulse per Round. Integrated dryads can use their senses as if the plant around them was air, as well as breathe normally (although they'd better separate before stopping the upkeep, or it’ll be the end). Similarly, dryads integrated with a plant can move through any plant material in a fashion similar to the Burrow power, with the exception that the dryad's movement is equal to her Pace (running is allowed). It's impossible to spot an integrated dryad by traditional means, and similarly it's tough to attack them in that state – although destroying what a dryad is hiding in is certainly an option. Doing so causes the dryad to be ejected, and inflicts 2 levels of Fatigue in the process.One With Nature:</p><p>Dryads get a +1 bonus to all checks on anything plant-related, often including Tracking and Survival, but this could just easily apply to Knowledge checks, herbal-based Healing rolls, and the like. This bonus increases to +2 in plant-rich environments, such as forests.Resistant:</p><p>Dryads are less affected by attacks or effects based on water and light. Against any such attacks they gain +2 Toughness, and they have a +2 bonus to any checks to resist such effects.</p>"
"Guild Mercenary","Novice, Fighting d8+ or Shooting d8+","Edge - Social","<p>Your adventurer is a member of the mercenaries guild, which grants him certain privileges. Upon registration your adventurer is given leather armor (embossed with the guild's emblem), and his choice of a bow or wrapped short sword – this is all standardissue. The guild member can also receive free meals and lodging at any mercenaries’ guild hall or the guild headquarters. Members also gain access to the guild's job postings, which allow access to available missions.</p><p>There is one catch: the mercenaries’ guild has an image to maintain. If an adventurer ever fails to complete a mission they received through the guild in a timely manner (assuming he hasn't died), he no longer receives the benefits of this Edge, and gains the Wanted (Minor) Hindrance until the matter can be resolved. While this can have some broad applications, the guild tends to apply it only once the transgression is obvious: deserting the field of battle, leaving the environs without good cause and permission, or simply letting a matter sit for a couple of months.</p>"
"House Knight","Novice, Fighting d8+, Riding d8+","Edge - Social","<p>House Knights are the bottom rung on the nobility ladder. Your knight is a member of a noble household and has certain bonus items at his disposal. In exchange for service to the Lord, a House Knight is given a long sword, a plate corselet embossed with the livery of theHouse, and medium shield. Access is also given to a horse, if necessary. A House Knight also receives a +2 Charisma bonus when dealing with common folk (including other knights), but not with any other nobles or elevated commoners (such as guild masters).</p>"
"House Spy","Novice, Lockpicking d6+, Notice d8+, Persuasion d6+, Stealth d8+","Edge - Professional","<p>Every House wants to know what the other Houses are up to. To that end, almost all of them have been known to either recruit or employ House spies. These individuals are notorious for picking up on the little things, getting into places they aren't wanted, and calmly talking their way back out.</p><p>A House spy gains a +2 Charisma bonus, as well as a +2 to any Notice and Stealth rolls – although the Stealth bonus only applies in urban settings, not in the wilderness.</p>"
"Impromptu Weapon","Novice","Edge - Combat","<p>Your adventurer can use pretty much anything as a weapon, and use it with some skill. Not just obvious things like shovels, chairs and bottles, but other mundane items too, like buckets or dishes. While wielding such objects your adventurer does not count as unarmed.</p><p>This also applies to ranged weapons; your adventurer is able to throw anything light enough. Nails, forks or stones make good ammunition, but so too do horse shoes, ornaments and dinner plates. The range of the object will depend very much on its properties but is unlikely to be much beyond 3/6/12.</p><p>The object wielded retains its properties of course, both material and physical. Your adventurer can't expect to do much damage with a pencil, nor block a sword thrust with a pillow. Such light-weight implements might do only Strength in damage, +1 or +2 for more dangerous items. More solid items do (Damage: Str+d4). Only truly large/heavy objects such as tables and the like can look forward to the lofty heights of (Damage: Str+d6). Items rarely last more than a few blows – rolling a 1 on your Skill die means that the improvised weapon becomes useless.</p>"
"Pulse Path - Druid","Novice, Sighted, Survival d6+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialization)","<p>In the lands around Caladon, it isn't uncommon for someone who is Sighted to turn his attention to the natural world around him. These individuals perceive the Pulse that flows through all things, and so they wish to preserve and protect the living spirit of Nature. Although many druids will take up a hermit's life out in the wilderness, watching over and living with the flora and fauna, some take up more 'practical' roles in settled areas. From there, they can ensure healthy crops and livestock, and occasionally even act as advisers to those who lead.</p><p>Upon taking this Edge, your adventurer receives the Wyrding (Vigor) Skill at d4 and two of the following rituals: Cleansing Rain, Earth Bond, Nature's Bounty, Plant Control, Spirit Dance, Wrathberry.</p><p>One With Nature:</p><p>Druids are very attuned to their natural surroundings – some might even argue they are part of them. As part of an action to perform a ritual, a druid may take a level of Fatigue and attempt to draw extra Pulse from the very land around him to fuel the ritual. The druid makes a Vigor check, and on a success can roll a die equal to his Spirit die type and gain that much Pulse. On a Raise, the druid may roll two dice equal to his Spirit die type. In all cases, the Pulse can exceed his normal maximum, but any Pulse not immediately spent in the planned ritual is applied to the druid as damage after which it dissipates.At the GM's option, there may be sacred places in the world that allow for either greater ease in drawing power, or even more power to draw off of. In the first case, the druid would gain a bonus to his Vigor check; in the second, the druid might gain a couple of bonus points, have his die type increased, or even gain additional dice for additional Raises. By the same token, there would then be places where drawing power was more difficult or where the power is weaker, causing the druid to suffer penalties to his Vigor check, or reducing the points, die type, or even number of dice available.</p>"
"Pulse Path - Enchanter","Novice, Enabled, Scribe d6+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialization)","<p>Enchanters make things – magical things imbued with diverse powers – and it’s often said they’re more at home in a dusty library than on the road to adventure. It certainly holds true in most cases. Any enchanter who leaves the comforts of home behind, forsaking his classes and studies, is usually looking for either new knowledge or practical experience. On the other hand, it’s not unknown for some unlucky enchanter to be assigned a guild mission in some little-known, out-of-the-way place where he’s forced to learn how to survive outside of the halls in which he have spent so much time. The only good news for him is how much those locals are likely to value the enchanter's craft.</p><p>Upon taking this Edge, your adventurer receives the Enchanting (Smarts) Skill at d4 and two of the following sigils: Compotis Foraminis, Gradior Conflare, Particeps Fabula, Procul Aspectus, Signum Accendo, Transigo Arma</p><p>Tokens:</p><p>An enchanter's craft is largely accomplished through the use of tokens – items bearing a sigil that can be released at a later time. In order to make a token, an enchanter must take an item and spend 10 minutes per point of Pulse being invested in the sigil to complete the process of binding power to the item. While the Pulse invested in a token regenerates normally, there is a theoretical limit to how many he can have at a given time.Each enchanter is taught how to craft a special pouch for holding tokens. As long as a token remains in the pouch, its power won't degrade – but once removed, it begins to lose its enchantment, eventually becoming useless after a number of days equal to the enchanter's Spirit. Additionally, an enchanter's pouch can only hold a number of tokens equal to twice his Smarts, and a single enchanter can only maintain a number of the same type of sigil equal to his Smarts. It takes an Action to pull a token from the pouch, and another to activate it – although both can be done in the same Round if the enchanter makes a successful Agility check (with a -2 penalty if he doesn't have Quick Draw).</p><p>Each token is given a 'command word' for triggering the sigil, and anyone who knows the word for a given token can use it. However, the item used to create the token is consumed and destroyed when it’s activated, causing most enchanters to use stones or other relatively worthless items for their creation. Also, because of the magical degradation, tokens given to other people need to be used relatively quickly, lest they become useless.</p>"
"Pulse Path - Protector","Novice, Empowered, Healing d6+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialization)","<p>Protectors are trained to be Shields of Trinity, their motive purpose being to protect her followers from those who would do them harm. While protectors are usually trained to fight in order to better defend their flock, it’s their defensive magic that sets them apart in the eyes of most folk and makes them invaluable to any adventuring group. And protectors do tend to adventure – they see it as a means to travel from place to place, while putting them in a position to help those in need.</p><p>Upon taking this Edge, the adventurer receives the Warding (Spirit) Skill at d4 and two of the following Prayers: Honoring Jolan The Brave, Honoring Sera The Healer, Honoring Sir Ewan The Shield, Honoring Willow The Open- Handed, Trinity's Blessing, Trinity's Light.</p><p>Protect The Flock:</p><p>Protectors are aptly named, and take their duty to Trinity and her people seriously. prayers cast in the aid of the innocent or weak enjoy a +2 bonus (your GM is the final arbiter of what constitutes aiding the innocent or weak, but generally an adventurer who’s taken a Wound or failed a Spirit check doesn’t count).</p>"
