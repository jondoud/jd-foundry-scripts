"Battlefield Angel\n","Novice, Healing d8+\n","Edge - Professional\n","<p>“Battlefield angel” is the nickname given to combat medic in the Wilderlands and anyone who owes their lives to one of these unsung heroes knows why. These people work in the most hostile environments imaginable, putting together torn bodies with staples, tape, and prayer. Every life saved is a miracle.</p><p>First, heroes with this Edge are used to scavenging for supplies. They take no penalties on their Healing rolls for lack of first aid kit or similar supplies, so long as they have something… even if it means plugging a finger in someone’s heart, or stitching them up with dental floss.</p><p>Second, medics in the Wilderlands don’t quit under pressure. They get a free reroll on Healing rolls to heal Wounds in hostile or battlefield environments.</p>"
"Cyberpulse Augmentation","","Edge - Gear","<p>Special (must have resources to pay for surgery).</p><p>Man has always sought to improve through technology, and with the discovery of Pulse, such augmentation became a reality. Upon taking this Edge and paying any surgical costs, your hero has a cyberPulse port or hard point installed. Through ports, the hero can use their own Pulse to power Pulse weapons and gear. Each time this Edge is taken, (maximum once per Rank), your hero gains another port (head, body, arm, or leg), or hard point (body only). A Medium size body can hold up to three ports/hard points in any mix. For different races the available body augments are entirely at your GM's discretion.</p><p>Plugging cyberPulse tech into a port normally takes an Action. Switching out the contents of a hard point typically takes an hour. Recharge costs and times vary by gear.</p>"
"Ley Line Whisperer\n","Arcane Skill: Ritual (Smarts)\n","Edge - Arcane Background\n","<p>Starting Powers: 3</p><p>Ley line whisperers are a type of shaman. With a successful Spirit check, they can sense all ley lines within 10km. With a Raise, they gain a sense of the mood of the ley lines within Spirit x2, potentially alerting the ley line whisperer to supernatural disturbances nearby.</p><p>Activation: Ley line whisperers must be able to speak and gesture (they cannot be Bound), to perform their rituals. Rituals take 1 minute per Pulse to prepare. The whisperer predetermines how much Pulse goes into the Power at that time including Power Modifiers. Once allocated, and the ritual is completed, the Power can be activated as an action requiring no roll. Pulse recharges after a Power has been activated.</p><p>So long as a ley line whisperer is within Spirit x2 of a ley line, they may roll Spirit to use the ley line’s Pulse to maintain Powers (with Duration longer than Instant), rerolling at each new Duration. Once Disrupted, they lose connection, and must recast via a prepared ritual.</p><p>Available Powers: arcane protection, banish, barrier, boost/lower trait, damage field, deflection, detect/conceal arcana, environmental protection, farsight, illusion, ley line senses, mind link, protection, smite, summon ally (spirits), telekinesis, walking between worlds, warrior gift.</p>"
