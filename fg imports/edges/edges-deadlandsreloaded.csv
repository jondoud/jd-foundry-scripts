Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Arcane Background (Magic)","Novice","Background Edge","<p>Magic in the Weird West is not to be taken lightly. Those who practice sorcery must often wrestle their powers from the dark spirits of the Weird West, who are rarely willing to give up easily. Hucksters envision these duels of will as card games, and the best are capable of amazing powers. It is rumored that others tread even darker paths, and harness the power of blood magic.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Miracles)","Novice","Background Edge","<p>Certain characters can call upon the power of their deity (or deities) for aid. In the Weird West, these pious souls are called the blessed. Blessed are nuns, priests, or even average but (relatively) pure-hearted folks blessed by a divine entity. Though rare in the Weird West, there are also blessed imams, Buddhist monks, and others of faith running around with higher powers covering their holy backsides. When these folks behave themselves, they can sometimes invoke miracles to help them fight the evils of the Weird West.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Shamanism)","Novice","Background Edge","<p>Shamans are Indian holy men and women, and keepers of tribal medicine. Their power comes from bargains with the demanding spirits of the natural world. When these medicine men honor the nature spirits, they can accomplish amazing feats that make even the most doubting Thomas tremble.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Chi Mastery)","Novice, Martial Arts","Background Edge","<p>A few folks in the Weird West have studied the ancient oriental fighting arts. A very few of these supremely skilled fighters have achieved spiritual discipline necessary to channel supernatural force through their own bodies, called chi. These enlightened fighters use the Arcane Background (Chi Mastery) Edge to reflect their astonishing abilities.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Weird Science)","Novice","Background Edge","<p>Adherents to the principles of New Science (called Mad Scientists by most) build weird and wonderful devices, machines which often seem to defy the very laws of reality. Most every such inventor (or at least the successful ones) rely on ghost rock to power their inventions in some fashion.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Black Magic)","Novice","Background Edge","<p>Unless otherwise stated, Arcane Background (Black Magic) works exactly like Arcane Background (Magic) from the <i>Savage Worlds</i> rulebook. Folks who know black magic have willingly given themselves and their souls to evil in return for a measure of infernal power. Which is to say they've gone <i>bad</i> and they've got no regrets to speak of.</p>"
"Conviction","Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), Spirit d6+, Faith d6+","Blessed Edge","<p>Some holy rollers seem to have the ear of the Almighty, and this lucky cuss seems to be just one such individual. He's more successful than most when petitioning the Lord with prayer, and his humble calls for divine assistance are answered regularly.</p><p>This hero gains a +2 modifier to all Faith rolls made to call down miracles.</p>"
"Flock","Seasoned, Arcane Background (Miracles), Spirit d8+, Faith d8+","Blessed Edge","<p>The greatest prophets and preachers are attended by followers. These men and women have found salvation of one sort or another in the blessed, and devoted their lives to his cause.</p><p>Flock gives your padre five followers who serve at his side in whatever capacity you choose. They have the stats of Townsfolk (see the <i>Marshal's Handbook</i>), though they can gain skills just like any other Allies. They come with nothing but the clothes on their back and a few dollars, but can be armed and outfitted however the blessed sees fit.</p><p>Members of the Flock who perish are slowly replaced over time (usually by giving a "revival"). The Edge may not be taken more than once until the blessed is Legendary. At that point he may take it as many times as he'd like (as well as the Followers Edge, if he so chooses).</p>"
"Voodoo","Novice, Arcane Background (Miracles), Spirit d8+, Faith d6+","Blessed Edge","<p>Voodoo works the same as other miracles, it just comes from a different place; powerful spirits named loa. Player character houngans (males) and mambos (females) get their power from <i>rada</i>, the "good guys" in the voodoo religion. (Evil voodooists get their mojo from <i>petro</i>.)</p><p>Voodoo priests must prepare their abilities ahead of time in elaborate rituals (this is where all that dancing around the fire and sacrificing chickens comes in). Each night the voodooist must contact the loa and enlist their aid for the day to come. With a Faith of d4, the ritual must last at least four hours. For each die type above d4, the time required is reduced by 30 minutes. So a houngan with Faith d8 must chant and dance for three hours in the evening to be able to call upon the spirits the next day. If the ritual is not completed, the voodooist cannot call on any miracles the next day. During the ritual, the individual's powers are focused into charms-rocks, feathers, chicken bones, and squishy stuff-carried in medicine bags, on a necklace, and so on.</p><p>When he wants to call on the power of a loa, the houngan takes an action to use a charm. He hurls a bone as an attack, rubs a cat's tooth for armor, and so on. Then he can make his Faith roll, look for raises, and so on. The charm is used up afterwards. If a voodooist is separated from his charms, he cannot work any miracles.</p><p>The upside to the inconvenience of nightly rituals is that Voodoo practitioners gain access to powers that other blessed characters do not. Most of these powers deal with curses, control, and contacting loas, the bread and butter of Voodoo. The additional powers are <i>curse, fear, mind rider, puppet, vision quest,</i> and <i>zombie</i>.</p><p>Finally, a voodoo practitioner is freed from the restrictions of the Sinnin' table. He or she is still fatigued if a power fails, and can still suffer the effects of a crisis of faith like other blessed characters, but mambos and houngans are not bound by Christian beliefs.</p>"
"Dealer's Choice","Novice, Arcane Background (Magic), Spellcasting d6+","Huckster Edge","<p>Your hero's never happier than when he has a deck of cards in his hands. Poker, faro, even patience, this huckster has card games in his blood.</p><p>Any time you are dealt a card for any reason, after you have looked at it you can choose to spend a Fate Chip to discard and draw another card.</p>"
"High Roller","Seasoned, Arcane Background (Magic), Spellcasting d6+, Guts d8+","Huckster Edge","<p>Go high or go home is your motto. You don't bother with lesser manitous. When dealing with the devil, your hombre draws an extra card. He may still only use five cards to form the hand, but now he has more choices.</p>"
"Improved High Roller","Veteran, High Roller.","Huckster Edge","<p>This Edge functions like High Roller, only the spellslinger draws two extra cards instead of one.</p>"
"Old Hand","Heroic, Arcane Background (Magic), Spellcasting d10+","Huckster Edge","<p>With knowledge comes power, and you know when to say when.</p><p>When dealing with the devil, red Jokers are wild cards but don't cause Backfire. Black Jokers still bring the pain as usual. (Make sure you can tell the difference before drawing cards.)</p>"
"Whateley Blood","Novice, Arcane Background (Magic)","Huckster Edge","<p>Somewhere in your family tree is a crooked branch called the "Whateleys." This twisted family of inbred witches and warlocks are well-known by arcane types as being both extremely powerful, and extremely crazy. It's a dangerous combination.</p><p>Many of the Whateleys are deformed, though your hero doesn't have to be (take the appropriate Hindrance if he is). All have some tell-tale mark-pale skin, jet black hair, long fingernails, sallow complexion, and so on, and all have green eyes.</p><p>Whatever mark you choose, there's something about their tainted blood that just puts folks off, and gives your descendant -2 Charisma.</p><p>It's entirely unfair, and we know it, but a female with Whateley blood can choose if her tell is unsettling (-2 Charisma) or exotic (+2 Charisma). We'll repeat it one more time. We know it ain't fair, so don't write to us whining about the "free Edge" sister Whateley got that her little brother didn't. (She'll have her hands full fending off suitors foolish enough to think about joining the family anyway.)</p><p>Now for the meat of what this Edge is all about. Hucksters with Whateley spirit running through their veins have learned "blood magic." They can voluntarily suffer a Fatigue level for 2 Power Points. They can suffer a wound for 1d6+1 Power Points. This is done exactly as you'd think it'd be-by cutting, carving, or otherwise maiming themselves. This is a free action-they're quick, those Whateleys- and so can be done in the same action as the spell they so desperately need to cast, with no multi-action penalty.</p><p>Since this is a free and instant action, the Whateley can actually render himself incapacitated and still get his spell off, if he should choose to do so. Good luck waking with your gear still in your pack, however.</p>"
"Fetish Creator","Novice, Arcane Background (Shamanism), Smarts d8+, Spirit d8+, Tribal Medicine d8+","Shaman Edge","<p>This is a shamanic version of the Gadgeteer Edge.</p><p>Once per game session, the shaman can create a magic talisman and imbue it with arcane energy. The device uses any power available to the shaman (though this is still subject to Rank restrictions). It has half the creator's Power points and once these are used up they do not recharge. The ritual to imbue the object takes 1d20 minutes. Activating the device requires a Spirit roll.</p>"
"Spirits' Favor","Seasoned, Arcane Background (Shamanism), Tribal Medicine d8+","Shaman Edge","<p>Normally a shaman who follows the Old Ways is proscribed from using technology under any circumstances. The shaman with this Edge may petition the spirits to allow him to use one normal technological device (no Mad Science gizmos or Infernal Devices) without offending them, in return for a surrender of personal power. Petitioning the spirits involves a ritual offering, which takes 1d10+10 minutes. This Edge may only be applied to one device at a time.</p><p>For as long as the shaman makes use of the device, he has 5 less Power Points than usual. When he stops using the device these points return at the usual rate. The shaman may abandon one item and switch to another, which requires another 1d10+10 minutes. During this time the favor does not apply to either device.</p>"
"Alchemy","Novice, Arcane Background (Weird Science), Knowledge (Chemistry) d8+","Mad Scientist Edge","<p>This character can make potions from his powers as well as devices. The downside to potions is they must be prepared ahead of time.</p><p>An alchemist character has half his normal Power Points per known power to divide among as many potions as he wishes. Extra points may be put into a potion to maintain the duration up to a predetermined limit. The alchemist can brew potions for each power he knows. Power Points are "tied up" in a potion until it is used.</p><p>Brewing a potion requires a chemistry set and 30 minutes per power. At the end of the brewing process, the alchemist must make a Weird Science roll. Failure means the potion is ruined. Success indicates it will work when used, and raises work as usual. Attack powers require a Throwing roll to hit (range of 3/6/12), and opposed powers require a normal success to resist (or -2 with a raise). Otherwise, no roll is needed to use a potion.</p>"
"Eureka!","Legendary, Arcane Background (Weird Science), Weird Science d12+","Mad Scientist Edge","<p>After tinkering and working, you may create a true Infernal Device out of one of your powers. When this Edge is taken, pick one power you currently have. The gizmo no longer uses Power Points, and thereafter functions solely on ghost rock.</p><p>One pound of ghost rock allows a maintainable power to be used for two hours of total use (regardless of its normal duration) and allows an Instant power to be used 20 times. For purposes of such powers, it's best to track each pound of ghost rock as 20 "charges." When the device runs out of fuel it's time to buy some more California coffee, hombre.</p><p>Your prototype is more stable than most other Infernal Devices; it only suffers a Malfunction on a critical failure. On top of that, your blueprints and patent earn you prestige and money from a corporation capable of reproducing your device on a mass market scale (most likely Smith &amp; Robards or Hellstromme Industries, but a Rail Baron or national government might also express interest). Thereafter, you have +2 Charisma when dealing with other mad scientists and receive 1d6 x $50 in royalties every month (which you'll probably need to pay the ghost rock bill).</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Drunken Style)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>You weave around like you're out of your tree on firewater, making your moves hard to follow or predict.</p><p>Your hombre has +1 Parry but has his Pace reduced by 2 when using this style due to his staggering gait.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Eagle Claw)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>This is a fast, vicious style where you hold your hands like claws and tear away at some poor sodbuster's pressure points.</p><p>Your Fighting attacks now inflict Str+d4 damage with AP 2.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Mantis)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>A mantis student holds his hands like hooks, and moves from mesmerizing calm to sudden strikes in a terrifying instant. Discard and redraw cards of 5 or lower dealt to your character in combat. If he has the Quick Edge, discard and redraw cards of 8 or lower.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Monkey)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>In this style, you hunker down, screw up your face, and then move with sneakiness and speed. This surprises opponents, who often underestimate you because you look so dang funny.</p><p>Your sneaky hombre gets +2 when making Taunt rolls or performing Agility Tricks.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Shaolin Temple)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>Moves are based on five animal styles. In the Crane, you jab at people with your fingers pressed tightly together like a beak and stand on one leg a lot. The Snake is sneaky and fluid. The Dragon relies on good old-fashioned punches to inflict crushing damage. The Leopard style is all knuckles. Finally, Tiger style is all about ripping away at your opponent's muscles.</p><p>Regardless of which form of Shaolin you choose, your hero's unarmed Fighting attacks inflict Str+d6 damage. The specific branch is just a matter of preference.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Shuai Chao)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>The practitioner grabs or throws his opponent, all the while sneaking in all sorts of jabs and rabbit punches. Watching this style in action is usually pretty confusing for your average cowpoke.</p><p>If your cowpoke Grapples an opponent and elects to inflict damage, he causes Str+d4 damage from a combination of the hold and sneaky punches.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Tai Chi)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>You focus your chi to such an exceptional degree that your attacks can knock your opponent halfway to Philadelphia, despite appearing as gentle as the breeze.</p><p>Opponents are knocked back 1d4" per success and raise on your character's Fighting roll. If they strike a solid object, such as a wall, they are automatically Shaken.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Tan Tui)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>This style relies predominantly on kicks, and we don't mean can-can style. Up in Shan Fan, this one's very popular with spectators at various martial arts tournaments.</p><p>Your hombre's kicks cause Str+d6 damage. He can use his powerful legs to rise from Prone at no movement cost.</p>"
"Superior Kung Fu (Wing Chun)","Novice, Arcane Background (Chi Mastery), Martial Arts, Spirit d6+, Fighting d8+","Martial Artist Edge","<p>This style emphasizes flurries of powerful blows, usually both offensive and defensive at the same time.</p><p>As long as your hero is attacking unarmed, he may make one additional Fighting attack at no penalty.</p>"
"Cat Eyes","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>The character gains +2 to his Notice rolls to spot visual clues, and ignores penalties for Dim and Dark lighting conditions.</p>"
"Improved Cat Eyes","Seasoned, Harrowed, Cat Eyes","Harrowed Edge","<p>The Harrowed can see in the dark, ignoring all penalties for lighting. He can also sense if a character within a few feet is a supernatural creature of some sort.</p>"
"Chill o' the Grave","Heroic, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>They say the grave is damp and cold, and this Harrowed has mastered the ability to radiate that chill from the Hunting Grounds through his body, lowering the ambient temperature around him noticeably.</p><p>The deader makes a Spirit roll to use this power. On a success, the temperature drops 10° F. Anyone experiencing this supernatural chill must make a Guts roll. On a raise, it drops 20° F and the Harrowed is surrounded by a dank mist. Witnesses must make a Guts roll at - 2.</p>"
"Claws","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>The character gains supernaturally sharp Claws that cause Str+d4 damage in combat. The claws may be extended or retracted at will.</p>"
"Improved Claws","Veteran, Harrowed, Claws","Harrowed Edge","<p>The deader's Claws have become longer and sharper and now inflict Str+d6 damage.</p>"
"Ghost","Seasoned, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>The Harrowed decides if he is corporeal or incorporeal at the beginning of each of his actions. He must remain in that state until his next action - he cannot attack and then go incorporeal.</p><p>While ghosted, the deader is intangible, though he is still visible and magical attacks affect him normally. The Harrowed may remain ghosted as long as he continues to concentrate. If he suffers damage while in this state, he must make a Spirit roll or become tangible once more.</p>"
"Hell Fire","Heroic, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>There's a reason why flames figure prominently in the Hells of pretty much every religion. Many supernatural beings have a love affair with the destructive power of fire.</p><p>A Harrowed with this power suffers one die less damage than usual from fire, though he will still catch fire if exposed to flames. What's more, with a successful Spirit roll, he can cause a fire to flare or die at his whim.</p><p>On a raise, he can extinguish the fire, or he can cause it to explode, showering everything in a Medium Burst Template in flames. Roll to see if flammable material ignites, as usual (see <i>Savage Worlds</i>).</p>"
"Implacable","Veteran, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>Most Harrowed take a while to get used to the fact that they don't suffer pain anymore. They still grunt when shot, and limp when their ankle gets chewed to hamburger by some unholy varmint. It's a mental thing.</p><p>Your hombre, on the other hand, has overcome this block - or he's too dumb to care. Either way, he ignores 2 points of wound penalties, cumulative with Nerves of Steel.</p>"
"Infest","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>Like animals, insects have spirits in the Hunting Grounds as well. The manitous have learned a few tricks to control these creatures.</p><p>A Harrowed with this power can control swarms of small biting, stinging insects. The creatures aren't created by the power, however, so they must be present in the surrounding terrain.</p><p>If the Harrowed does nothing but concentrate on this power for three rounds, he can summon a swarm of insects; one swarm template for each three rounds of concentration. Use the stats from the <i>Savage Worlds</i> rules for each swarm.</p>"
"Soul Eater","Veteran, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>This nasty ability, one of the Harrowed's cruelest weapons, allows the walking corpse to drain a victim of his life force.</p><p>Immediately after inflicting a wound with his bare hands (or claws), the character makes a Spirit roll opposed by his victim (even if the foe is going down). Should he win, the Harrowed can restore a lost Fatigue level. If he has no Fatigue, he can restore a wound instead. A raise on the Spirit roll allows him to heal two Fatigue levels (or two wounds).</p>"
"Spook","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>The Harrowed draws upon the power of the manitou within him to lend a little extra substance to his intimidating glare or grating voice. When the Harrowed makes an Intimidation roll and scores a raise, Extras are Panicked and Wild Cards must roll on the Fright Table (see the Savage Worlds rules).</p>"
"Stitchin'","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>A dead man with Stitchin' regenerates damage much faster than normal - he may make natural Healing rolls every day, provided he consumes a pound of meat for each attempt, as usual.</p>"
"Improved Stitchin'","Veteran, Harrowed, Stitchin'","Harrowed Edge","<p>As Stitchin', but the deader may roll every hour.</p>"
"Supernatural Attribute","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>Supernatural Attribute immediately improves any one attribute two die types (a d12 becomes a d12+2, and so on). This Edge may be taken up to five times, once for each attribute. Note that it does not apply to skills.</p>"
"Wither","Novice, Harrowed","Harrowed Edge","<p>The taint of death hangs heavy around this deader and this ability allows him to pass some of that unwholesome energy to others.</p><p>This power allows a Harrowed to cause something he touches to age prematurely. Whatever he is attempting to affect, it must be no bigger than the size of the Harrowed's hand. On a successful Spirit roll, he ages the thing by a month. On a raise, it ages by a year. Though this power cannot harm something as large as a human, it does cause food to putrefy, wood to rot, and metal to rust.</p>"
"Veteran o' the Weird West","Wild Card, Novice, Guts d6+, Knowledge (Occult) d6+","Background Edge","<p>So you want to be a hero, huh? A big, tough, experienced hero? No problem. Just check your sanity at the door, because those who have already been around the cactus a few times have seen things that would stop most men's tickers. As a result, they ain't the same as they used to be!</p><p>Veterans o' the Weird West begin play at Seasoned (or one Rank higher than the rest of the cowpokes in your campaign), which means they gain 20 Experience Points to begin the game with. Go ahead and advance your hero normally, as described in the Savage Worlds rules.</p><p>There's a price, though. If you take this Edge, you must draw a single card from the action deck once you're done creating your cowpoke. Show it to your Marshal and he'll check the table in the Marshal's Handbook to see just what kind of bad luck your hombre wandered into on his path to studliness. If you draw a Joker, draw again and tell your Marshal whether you drew a black card or a red card (or another Joker).</p><p>Beware-the results can be quite extreme, from maiming to insanity. Your Marshal has the details. You've been warned!</p>"
"Duelist","Wild Card, Novice, Shooting d6+","Combat Edge","<p>Your hombre is a deadly gunfighter, and anyone foolish enough to face him at High Noon winds up in the boneyard by sunset.</p><p>In a duel, this hero receives an extra hole card for each point of Grit he has.</p>"
"Hip-Shooting","Seasoned, Shooting d8+","Combat Edge","<p>Any hombre can fan a single-action pistol, but your hero's a natural hip-shooter. He suffers only a -2 to his Shooting rolls when fanning the hammer</p>"
"Improved Hip-Shooting","Heroic, Shooting d10+, Hip-Shooting","Combat Edge","<p>Your hero's got fanning down to a fine art. He suffers no penalty to his Shooting roll when fanning the hammer.</p>"
"Martial Arts","Novice, Fighting d6+","Combat Edge","<p>You've trained in martial arts or boxing, or learned to street fight <i>really</i> dirty. Your character's body is a finely honed weapon, so even when your hero fights unarmed, he is considered armed. In addition, opponents in melee combat never benefit from any gang up bonus against your hero.</p>"
"Rebel Yell","Novice, hero must be from the CSA","Combat Edge","<p>The blood-curdling Rebel Yell has terrified Yankees and emboldened Confederates from Manassas on. Sure, the shooting has mostly stopped now, but feelings run pretty deep on both sides and when the blood is up, this war cry can still elicit the same responses.</p><p>When used, the Reb may make an Intimidation roll against all targets in an area (as opposed to a single victim as usual). Place a Large Burst Template adjacent to the character (a 6" area of effect, with the edge adjacent to the cowpoke). Every creature within the circle must roll Spirit against the character's Intimidation total.</p>"
"Speed Load","Seasoned, Agility d8+, Shooting d6+","Combat Edge","<p>Your pistolero has mastered the fine art of loading his six-gun in an all-fired hurry. Your hero can reload one weapon on his action, ignoring the usual -2 penalty to Shooting rolls in the same round.</p><p>If your hero is using a weapon that requires a full round or more to reload, the time required is reduced by 1 round.</p>"
"Card Sharp","Novice, Gambling d6+","Social Edge","<p>Your hero has a way with a deck and never feels more at home than when he's shuffling cards. He's learned a whole heap of ways to cut, shuffle, and deal that give him an edge in a game.</p><p>A gambler with this Edge only gets caught cheating on a roll of snake eyes. What's more, if your hero's a Huckster, folks get a -2 to Notice rolls when trying to spot a hex being cast.</p>"
"Reputation","Veteran","Social Edge","<p>Whether the character is branded a hero or villain, he has earned a reputation across the West. He may add his Charisma to Intimidation rolls. A negative score is treated as positive for this purpose (and the character has a bad reputation).</p>"
"True Grit","Wild Card, Novice, Spirit d8+","Social Edge","<p>Some folks just seem to exude toughness, and your hero is one of them. The horrors of life in the Weird West don't faze this hombre. He's got gravel in his gut and ice water running through his veins.</p><p>Your hero's cool demeanor gives him +1 Grit.</p>"
"Agent","Seasoned, Smarts d8+, Fighting d6+, Knowledge (Law) d4+, Knowledge (Occult) d6+, Investigation d6+, Shooting d6+","Professional Edge","<p>The shadowy Agency is the Union's answer to the mysterious occurrences some say are happening in the world. Its Agents are a secretive lot, and do not share information outside their ranks if they can avoid it, not even with the local law.</p><p>This Edge is for full-time Agents beholden to the Agency. Other characters may work for the Agency on a part-time "troubleshooter" basis, but only those who work for the Agency every minute of every day of their lives until they retire (rarely) or die (much more common) should take this Edge.</p><p>Agents are expected to spy on the enemies of the Union, seek out and contain, destroy, or capture weird creatures, and generally follow the orders handed down to them by the Agency itself.</p><p>These secretive servants of the Union have jurisdiction anywhere within its borders, but are expected not to reveal their credentials except under extreme and desperate circumstances.</p><p>Agents receive a free Gatling pistol upon completion of their training course and always add +1 to their Guts checks.</p><p>Agents are simply ranked as Grade 0 through 5. Grade 6 is reserved for the legendary leader of the Agency, the "Ghost," though rumors of his recent demise are widely circulated.</p><p>Agent characters begin at Grade 0, and test for promotion upon the completion of each assignment or the destruction of some great evil (Marshal's call). See the Promotion Table for the procedure.</p>"
"Scout","Novice, Notice d6+, Tracking d6+","Professional Edge","<p>Scouts have learned to watch the signs and trust their instincts when it comes to navigating the vast wilderness.</p><p>Any time the Marshal draws a face card while traveling (indicating a random encounter has occurred), a scout may make a Notice roll (-2). If successful, the scout detects the hazard, creature, or situation at the earliest opportunity, likely giving his party time to avoid it or at least attack it on their own terms. Don't forget to remind the Marshal you have this Edge if your posse's going to be traveling.</p><p>Scouts also gain +2 to Notice rolls made to avoid surprise in tactical situations.</p>"
"Snakeoil Salesman","Novice, Smarts d6+, Spirit d6+, Persuasion d8+","Professional Edge","<p>With honey-dewed lips that weave lies and fabrications like they were the Gospel truth, this smooth talker could sell salt to the Mormons and buffalo hides to Indians.</p><p>The character gains a +2 bonus to noncombat Persuasion rolls. He can also use his forked tongue to initiate a Persuasion Test of Will, opposed by the target's Smarts.</p>"
"Soldier","Special","Professional Edge","<p>A hero with this Edge may start as a private, NCO, or officer when he takes this Edge. Each step comes with its own perks and responsibilities - it's not necessarily better to be an officer instead of an NCO or private.</p><p>Characters may also be demoted a number of ranks if they perform poorly, abandon their post, disobey orders, or otherwise operate outside the code of military conduct. Demotions are subjective and entirely up to the Marshal, and no roll is required.</p><p>Soldiers are on duty 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Those who decide to run off on personal adventures without permission may find themselves victims of a court martial or even summary execution!</p><p>Characters aren't expected to take entire companies on traditional adventures, of course (though this is Savage Worlds, so they could!), but the Rank Table lists the resources they may be able to draw upon if the situation warrants.</p>            "
"Private","Novice, Fighting d6+, Shooting d6+","Professional Edge","<p><b>Privates</b> get regular food, pay, and their gear, which includes a uniform, Winchester '73 rifle with 20 rounds, canteen, bedroll, and a horse if the private is part of a cavalry troop.</p><p>Privates always subtract 2 from Promotion rolls. Once they are promoted to corporals, they no longer suffer the penalty. Corporals who gain promotions become NCOs.</p>"
"NCO","Seasoned, Fighting d6+, Intimidation d6+, Shooting d6+","Professional Edge","<p><b>Noncommissioned Officers (NCOs)</b> in the Union or Confederate Army start as sergeants and lead squads of ten privates. As NCOs advance through the ranks, they lead larger and larger formations. Note, however, that they are held directly responsible for the lives of the men under their command, their performance, and morale. As a result, NCOs are renowned for being vigilant and tough.</p><p>Sergeants start play with the same gear given to a private, plus an Army pistol and 20 rounds. Sergeants also gain +1 Charisma due to their rank when dealing with those who respect their authority.</p>"
"Officer","Novice, Smarts d6+, Knowledge (Battle) d6+","Professional Edge","<p><b>Officers</b> lead a command, depending on their rank, as shown on the table below. Unlike NCOs, officers are often held responsible for operations and battles before individual lives, though they must often weigh these lives carefully against defeat.</p><p>Officers gain +2 Charisma when dealing with those who respect their authority. Officers are given a uniform, saber, an Army pistol with 20 rounds, and a horse if commissioned by the cavalry.</p>"
"Tale Teller","Novice, Persuasion d8+","Professional Edge","<p>A good storyteller not only entertains, he gives hope and comfort as well. Sodbusters and saddletramps in the Weird West can use all the hope and comfort they can find. We don't want to say too much, but good tale tellers are critical to saving the world.</p><p>What? The world needs saving? You bet it does. You'll discover why eventually. In the meantime, know that spreading the tales of your posse's derring-do is far more important in the grand scheme of things than the ability to fire a gun or ride. So if you do something amazing, bucko, tell people about it!</p><p>The <i>Marshal's Handbook</i> has the skinny on all this, but you need to know what the Edge does, so we'll share this much with you now. When making a Persuasion roll to tell a tale of his posse's exploits, an orator with this Edge gains a +2 bonus. Furthermore, where most tale tellers bungle the story when they roll a 1 on the Persuasion die (regardless of the result of the Wild Die), your hero does so only on a roll of snake eyes.</p><p>When a tale teller with this Edge successfully lowers a Fear Level, he gets a one-time, one-use Legend Chip all his own (it doesn't go into the players' pot like other Fate Chips do, it goes straight to the player). Talk to the Marshal about this, amigo. We've already told you more than we should.</p>"
"Texas Ranger","Seasoned, Vigor d8+, Fighting d6+, Riding d6+, Shooting d6+, Streetwise d6+, Survival d6+, Tracking d6+","Professional Edge","<p>The South uses the Texas Rangers to police its interior. These hardened men hunt the High Plains and other regions for outlaws, bandits, deserters, and Union spies. The <i>Tombstone Epitaph</i> claims that, like the Agency, they are tasked with seeking out stranger prey as well, but only crackpots believe those bedtime stories, right?</p><p>Rangers advance along military ranks, but always start as privates. Ranger privates are given a badge (giving them +2 Charisma to those who respect its authority, and jurisdiction over all civilians of the Confederacy), a copy of <i>Fugitives from Justice</i> (giving them +2 to Law-based Common Knowledge rolls), and a general direction to mosey toward.</p><p>Pay is slightly higher for the Rangers than for their Union counterparts, but Rangers of all ranks are expected to handle things themselves according to the old creed, "One riot, one Ranger."</p><p>On the completion of every encounter with outlaws or other weirdness, the Ranger must report in and the Marshal can check for promotion on the promotion table</p><p>For you Ranger types, there's more information about these tough hombres and their secretive ways in the No Mans Land section. Check with your Marshal before you read it, partner.</p><!-- TODO Link to the Secret Services Section -->"
"Wilderness Man","Novice, Smarts d8+, Vigor d6+, Notice d8+, Survival d6+, Tracking d6+","Professional Edge","<p>Whether they live in the high Rockies, the Great Plains, or the deserts, wilderness men are used to the rigors of nature and take extremes of weather in stride.</p><p>They gain +2 to Survival and Tracking. In addition, lifetimes of exposure to nature's fury give them a +2 bonus to Vigor rolls to resist Fatigue from Heat or Cold</p>"
"Fates Favored","Wild Card, Seasoned","Weird Edge","<p>This cowpoke's got someone watching out for him, and he can trust Lady Luck to come through in a pinch. Once per session, he may spend a Fate Chip of any color and treat it as if it were a blue chip. Fate's Favored may be selected more than once, but only one time per Rank. Each time you choose it, your hero gains another use of the ability in each session.</p>"
"Knack","Wild Card, Novice","Weird Edge","<p>This Edge should only be taken during character creation (unless there is a good reason for the hero to "discover" his latent powers at a later date).</p><p>The Weird West is a superstitious place, where rumors and old wives' tales abound. Just occasionally, though, these folktales contain a germ of truth. A knack is just that- folklore come true.</p><p>Well, now you get to choose one of the special events that coincided with the time of your birth. Each one gives you access to a special ability, which you can activate by using a Fate Chip (of any color). If you don't have a Fate Chip to spare, you can't use your knack.</p><p><b>Bastard:</b> Well, that's what your hero is. Not the mean ornery kind, but the fatherless kind. A child born out of wedlock is said to be able to see the unseen.</p><p>Discard a Fate Chip to be able to see invisible critters, or those that supernaturally blend in with their surroundings.</p><p><b>Born on All Hallow's Eve:</b> They say the King of Halloween favors those born on his day of mischief, and grants them a greater understanding of the arcane world. As one of these rascals, your hero can only choose Magic and Weird Science Arcane Backgrounds. If you've already set your heart on a different Arcane Background, you'll have to choose another knack.</p><p>A Weird Scientist with this knack can discard a Fate Chip and make a successful Spirit roll to avoid dementia as a result of taking the New Powers Edge.</p><p>A huckster with this knack can discard a Fate Chip and make a successful Spirit roll to avoid Backfire after making a poker hand to cast a hex. With a success he is just Shaken as if by Backlash, and with a raise, he avoids it completely.</p><p><b>Born on Christmas:</b> A babe born on Christmas is particularly resistant to arcane effects powered by evil spirits. As such, your hero can only use Miracles and Shamanism Arcane Backgrounds. If you wanted to take a different Arcane Background, this isn't the knack for you.</p><p>When targeted by a power from any other Arcane Background, a hero with this knack can discard a Fate Chip to negate the effect and force the caster to make a Spirit roll (-4) or be Shaken.</p><p><b>Breech Birth:</b> A baby born butt-first is said to have the uncanny ability to heal injuries.</p><p>Your hero is just such a person and can spend a Fate Chip to use the greater healing power. He doesn't need to roll, he automatically gets a single success (thus healing one wound).</p><p><b>Seventh Son:</b> Your hero is fated for greatness; his legend will loom large in the Weird West.</p><p>This hombre has the ability to control fate. Any time a Fate Chip is used in his presence, he can discard a like-colored chip to negate its effect.</p>"
"Behold a Pale Horse","Legendary","Legendary Edge","<p>The Lone Ranger had Silver, Zorro had Toronado, and your steed is no less impressive. Whether it is a new stallion you've just broken in, or the same faithful pony you've had since you were young, there is something special about your horse. It has character.</p><p>Your faithful beast uses the statistics for a war horse (see the Savage Worlds rules) but gains the Fearless special ability and the Danger Sense Edge. What's more, the horse is a Wild Card. That's right, muchacho, your horse has its own Fate Chips and can do all the things a Wild Card can do. If the trusty steed dies, however, you have to choose this Edge again, or lose the benefit.</p>"
"Damned","Legendary, Reputation","Legendary Edge","<p>Old gunslingers don't die, they just...</p><p>Okay, they do die. Usually in messy and embarrassing ways. But if your grizzled veteran of the Weird West goes down, he's definitely coming back. Taking this Edge is something of an insurance policy against having your plans for this old hand ended prematurely.</p><p>If your hero is killed, he automatically returns from the grave, a Harrowed (and we're not talking suicide here). Just how long that takes relies on the Marshal's whim and the story. It could be near-instant, or it could be after your partners put you in a pine box and read the 23rd psalm.</p><p>The <i>Marshal's Handbook</i> has more information on this weird state of affairs. Death is just the beginning, amigo!</p>"
"Fast as Lightning","Legendary, Quick, Agility d10+","Legendary Edge","<p>When your hero reaches for his shootin' irons, folks rarely have time to blink, much less draw him down. Some say he's the fastest gun in the West.</p><p>Whether that's true or not, he's quick, real quick. Any time your hero is dealt lower than a ten for initiative, treat his card as a ten of the same suit.</p>"
"Right Hand of the Devil","Legendary, Shooting, Fighting, or Throwing d10+","Legendary Edge","<p>Your hero is fast on the trigger and renowned far and wide as one mean hombre in a fight. Folks have taken to calling him the right hand of the devil (or left hand of the devil if your cowpoke is of the sinister rather than dexter persuasion).</p><p>Whichever weapon you hero uses in his favored hand has been infused with some of the mythic status he is accorded, turning that weapon into a powerful relic. A relic weapon does an extra damage die of the same type as that weapon's highest damage die. So a relic Colt revolving rifle would do a fearsome 3d8 damage.</p><p>Of course, the Edge remains with the weapon, so if you lose your gun, you lose the Edge and whoever takes the weapon gains the benefit of the relic.</p>"
