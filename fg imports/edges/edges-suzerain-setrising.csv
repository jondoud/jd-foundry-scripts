"Anubite","Spirit d6+\n","Edge - Background, Racial\n","<p>Anubis’ children resemble their father greatly, being human but with the head of a black-furred jackal. They usually have dark blue or green eyes, though other eye colors are possible. They prefer to dress in black and gold and have a penchant for funerary items.

"Aspect Form","Demigod, Patron God (any Techno-Egyptian)","Edge - Racial","<p>If your character isn’t from one of the native races of the Techno-Egyptian realm, he may still be able to get some of those sweet benefits with the help of a patron god. By the time a character’s a demigod he’s starting to come into his power, so if he has a patron god this is where he can get an extra boost, by taking on the form of his god’s aspect. Not only can it put the scare on the bad guys, it looks cool to boot. Take Anubis as your character’s patron god and he’ll be able to shape-change to a sweet jackalheaded human, glowing with power and ready to unleash some righteous judgment. Your demigod wants to get in touch with his dexterous side? Pick Bast and prepare for him to move like a cat on a hot tin roof.</p><p>Aspect of Ra:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a golden Pharaoh infused with light, +1 to all trait checks.Aspect of Bast:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a humanoid cat Pharaoh, +2 to all Agility and Spirit-based rolls.Aspect of Anubis:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a humanoid jackal Pharaoh, +2 to all Vigor and Strengthbased rolls.Aspect of Thoth:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a humanoid bird (Ibis) or ape (Baboon) Pharaoh, +2 to all Smarts and Spirit-based rolls.Aspect of Horus:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a humanoid falcon Pharaoh, +2 to all Agility and Smartsbased rolls.Aspect of Osiris:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a greenskinned Pharaoh, +2 to all Spirit and Vigor-based rolls.Aspect of Hathor:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a bull or alluring humanoid Pharaoh, +2 to all Vigor rolls and +4 to Charisma.Aspect of Ptah:</p><p>Demigod’s form changes to a Mummified Pharaoh, +2 to all Smarts-based rolls and +4 to all Repair rolls.

"Assistant","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can concentrate on maintaining his magic Powers for him, reducing the concentration penalty by 1 per Telesma rank. It also grants +2 to checks made to keep Powers going when your character suffers damage.</p>"
"Attribute Synergy","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is particularly adept in one of the five core Attributes and able to guide and influence the same Attribute in your character, increasing his Wild Die one step when rolling that Attribute. This option can be taken multiple times, applying to a new Attribute each time.</p>"
"Balm","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can soothe his Fatigue, reducing the Fatigue track by a single level once per day.</p>"
"Bastet","Agility d6+\n","Edge - Background, Racial\n","<p>The graceful and feline children of the goddess Bast, the Bastet share their mother’s looks right down to the cat head. Males tend to be built a little bigger than females and have a more lion-style mane of hair compared to the women. They all have the upper and lower body of a person and the head of a cat. They’re lightly muscular and have a variety of fur and eye colors. They’re very agile and anything they do involving an Agility check gains a bonus of +1. The children of Bast tend to dress fairly provocatively — the women prefer clothes which swish or cling.</p>"
"Forced Manifestation","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can trick, tear, or finagle spirits into the physical world. This causes the targeted spirit to become dual-aligned (see page 11). Doing so costs your character 5 Pulse. This effect lasts for five Rounds, and can be extended another 5 Rounds by paying an extra 5 Pulse.</p>"
"Hard-Light Honcho","Heroic","Edge - Professional","<p>In the Techno-Egyptian world there’s sunlight and there’s Hard-light. It’s a crazy little bit of Ra’s Hypertech which totally blows the competition out of the water. It’s basically solid light, light which can be used like mortals would bend metal, make objects out of wood and so on. In the case of Hard-light it’s formed around a control surface and focus, springing into being in a blaze of radiance. It’s used for weapons, vehicles, storage and anything Ra turns his corporate mind to.</p><p>The Hard-light Honcho is a master of Hard-light and can build Hard-light devices given enough time, money and the right circuitry for the focus object. From Ra’s cool ‘shades’ to the fastest sports car in the Maelstrom, Hardlight is the way to go. Additionally, the Honcho can repair Hypertech-based items. Gain +2 on any Knowledge: Hard-Light or Repair checks relating to Hard-light. Your hero also counts as always having basic tools for the purposes of creating or modifying Hard-light items.</p>"
"Hyper-Sorcerer","Smarts d10, Strength d8, Heroic, Enabled (see Savage Suzerain for more on Enabled, and Pulse Paths in general)","Edge - Specialist Pulse Path","<p>A new tactic for Ra, his Hyper-Sorcerers are scriveners-meet-wizards who combine technology and magic. The Hyper-Sorcerers are able to use the powerful hologyph method to channel devastating mystical effects. They can hurl bolts of lightning, summon storms, cross vast distances in the blink of an eye and so much more. Of course, the only way to learn about this kind of thing is to enroll in Thoth’s University, where the god of knowledge and the Hypertech Corporation teach it cooperatively. Advanced concepts of hologlyph control are taught along with a healthy respect for the power itself.</p><p>Upon taking this Edge a character gains the skill Hyper-Sorcery at d4 and can choose 2 Powers from either the</p><p>Savage Suzerain Enabled Pulse Path or the following hologlyphs: Hard-light Blink, Hard-light Cascade, Hologlyph Duplicate, Hologlyph Storm, Refraction, Tri-Light Shatter Bolt.</p>"
"Karma Bank","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character may store 1 unspent Karma at the end of a session. This may be used in later sessions. The bank can hold only 1 Karma at any given time.</p>"
"Patron God: Ptah","Heroic, no other Patron God Edges","Edge - Weird","<p>The god Ptah was supposedly the creator, who spoke the words and brought the world into being. He’s certainly a dab hand with Ra’s Hard-light tech and this is exactly what he does. He works in the Hypertech Corporation as the head of Ra’s Research and Development division and gives new projects the once-over. He appears as an elderly man, dark skinned with short graying hair (including a close cut grey beard) and has a deep sonorous voice. He wears a crisp white suit with gold trim and you’ll never see him without a tech-spanner or some form of tool close to hand. The hero gets one of these abilities when he first takes the Edge, another at Demigod rank. If he takes the Edge when he’s at Demigod rank, he gets two abilities immediately:</p><p><b>Creation Of Ptah: </b>With a single spoken word, usually translated from a hologlyph — the hero can bring into being an inanimate object, even one as complex as a firearm. There’s one limit: nothing bigger than you can easily carry in two hands. A bicycle, a gun, a fancy bottle of wine... those are all fine. The complexity of the item determines the Pulse cost — a very simple item costs 1 Pulse whereas something with complex moving parts like a gun, or complex chemicals (explosives or acid for instance), is a 3 Pulse cost. Nuclear bombs and Hardlight tech are too complex to make with this Power. Once created the item lasts for 4 Rounds, but can be maintained by paying the Pulse cost again for another 4 Rounds of use. And no, the hero can’t create “the key to that vault” unless he already knows exactly what the key should look like. Nice try.</p><p><b>Crafter’s Zone: </b>Does the hero need a quiet place to work, a toolshed to make an awesome death-dealing device of ultimate destruction? Never fear, this is where Ptah gives him the ability to summon a portable workstation, replete with all the Hard-light tools he’d ever need and even a storage space for materials. For 1 Pulse the hero gains access to a workshop with all the tools needed for his current task, giving him a +2 to Repair or appropriate skill checks. The workshop lasts for 6 hours or until the task is complete, whichever comes first.</p><p><b>How It Works: </b>The hero gains a full insight into an inanimate object he touches. He knows how it was made, the steps of its construction and how to take it apart if need be. Note, this does not work on something as complex as the whole Osiris ship, but can be used on individual systems. The hero pays 1 Pulse and gains enough of an understanding to remove any penalties incurred by using an unfamiliar system. By paying 2 Pulse he gains an indepth understanding of how it works and gains a +2 to any checks to Repair or operate the device. Both uses of this Power last for 3 Rounds, or for the duration of a single extended action e.g. 1 hour of work covered by a single Repair check.</p>"
"Patron God: Ra","Heroic, no other Patron God Edges","Edge - Weird","<p>Ra is the sun god, the all-father of the Egyptian Pantheon and the genius behind Hypertech. If this god is your demigod’s chosen patron then prepare for good times, a decent paycheck and more importantly, the trust and friendship of Ra himself. He likes to get personal with his employees and those who shake the sun god’s hand find themselves with perks galore. Ra offers several powers to those who follow him, based on his command of the sun and Hard-light technology. The hero gets one of these abilities when he first takes the Edge, another at Demigod rank. If he takes the Edge when he’s at Demigod rank, he gets two abilities immediately:</p><p><b>Healing Blaze: </b>Down and out, friends dying all around you? Ra can help; this aspect of his Edge will let your demigod burn away hurt like never before. It costs 20 Pulse to activate and takes 4 Rounds to power up. In a Large Burst Template: drive away disease, heal the sick and injured, bring back someone from the brink of death and wipe away pain. Ra’s cleansing sunlight will also remove mental illness from the mind of the afflicted. The hero can choose who in the Large Burst Template is affected by this Power. Everyone affected is cured of any disease or poison they might be suffering from, have the Healing Power cast on them with a Raise, and remove any on-going negative effects they might be subject to, e.g. Stun or Puppet.</p><p><b>Ra’s Generosity: </b>Once per adventure your hero can call on Ra for a favor. It can be a sweet piece of equipment, some soldiers, or another favor entirely. It has to be within the bounds for Ra to grant, not a request he’d consider greedy, and for a purpose he’d approve of — so you can’t ask for a bajillion-squillion dollars to retire and live a life of boundless debauchery, for instance. He might send an attaché case with a cool million in though, if it’ll pay the ransom on one of his favored servants.</p><p><b>Sunburst: </b>Otherwise known as the Vampire Bane, this little trick allows the devotee of Ra to kick in a blast of powerful light. It blinds enemies in a Large Burst Template and drives back evil creatures. It will fry low rank vampires instantly, turning them to dust unless you happen to be in a realm where vampires go out in sunlight. That would be a downer, but some realms are like that. It costs 5 Pulse to activate. Place the Large Burst Template on the hero and everyone touched who doesn’t have Ra as their Patron God takes Damage: 2d6 and is affected by the Blind Power cast with a Raise. Creatures with the Ethereal or Undead Abilities take Damage: 2d8 instead, unless they have special rules that say otherwise (Savage Worlds vampires take Damage: 2d10). The effect counts as direct sunlight.</p>"
"Patron God: Thoth","Heroic, no other Patron God Edges","Edge - Weird","<p>The patron god of writing and knowledge, Thoth’s the one maintaining the university structure in the Techno-Egyptian cities and is guardian of the library system. Thoth invented the language of hieroglyphs and then went on to modernize it with the hologlyph,. Since then, he’s added a few more iterations, including Information Technology. He dumped his old image of an ibis-headed humanoid, eschewing it for something a little snazzier. Thoth now appears as a guy in a grey suit with an ibis pin attached to his right lapel. He seems to be young, yet wise, with a wicked spark behind his eyes. He’s the perfect patron for a demigod desiring knowledge and can often illuminate even the darkest mysteries. The hero gets one of these abilities when he first takes the Edge, another at Demigod rank. If he takes the Edge when he’s at Demigod rank, he gets two abilities immediately:</p><p><b>Direct Interface: </b>Thoth isn’t just the patron of the written word on paper; he can affect computer systems as well. Now the hero can too, by touching the computer in question to directly interface with it. This gives him a +4 to bypass security systems and run core level programs, all directly from his mind! This costs 2 Pulse per attempt.</p><p><b>Illuminate The Impossible: </b>Thoth grants the hero the ability to break a complex puzzle down into separate pieces, unlocking a code, cracking a cipher and seeing the truth behind a hidden picture. For any such tasks the hero gains +1 to his roll per point of Pulse he uses before the roll, to a maximum of +4. Even when it’s something secret he senses when his might be useful (so if you’re the GM, give your player a hint that it’s a good time to invest Pulse in scrutinizing that picture).Universal Translator:</p><p>Thoth grants the hero the ability to read any language, living, dead or otherwise (undead languages, perhaps?). This lasts for a full 24 hours and requires the expenditure of 3 Pulse.</p>"
"Protective","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma emits a protective field of Pulse around his physical body shielding him from harm. This grants your character +1 Toughness.</p>"
"Pulse Battery","Telesma","Edge- Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma acts as a battery containing 1 Pulse per rank of the Telesma. This replenishes every 24 hours. This option may be taken multiple times, each time increasing the Pulse per rank by 1.</p>"
"Sand Healing","Heroic, Spirit d10, Vigor d8, Empowered (see Savage Suzerain for more on Empowered, and Pulse Paths in general)","Edge - Specialist Pulse Path","<p>The art of Sand Healing is a powerful magic, practiced primarily in the Sunfire Domain. It soothes pain, heals wounds and can reset broken bones. It’s the only “old school” magical power Ra really tolerates (it comes from the combined gods and goddesses of the pantheon). He can’t see the harm in making someone better — even when his beloved technology fails him.</p><p>Still, he maintains a very close eye on this craft and those who use it. Practitioners must purchase a license from the CEO (Central Egyptian Overlord) to learn this particular Edge. It costs 100 dollars — Ra rather likes the sound of dollars — to obtain the proper credentials.</p><p>Upon taking the Edge a character gains the skill Sand Healing at d4 and can choose 2 Powers for either the Empowered Pulse Path list or from the following Sand Healer powers list: Cauterize, Knockout, Numb The Pain, Reset Bones, Sand Saw, and Sand Surgery.</p>"
"Sobeki","Sobeki, Vigor d10+\n","Edge - Background, Racial\n","<p>The people of the god Sobek have a humanoid lower half, with the shoulders and head of a large crocodile. They’ve powerful jaws and slightly webbed fingers which aid in swimming. They’ve adapted to living out of water and are comfortable in the dry heat of the Sunfire Domain. They’re loyal and work well in the heavy lifting and security sectors; they make excellent bodyguards and hired muscle for various illegal activities. They gain +2 to any check made to resist the effects of extreme heat and their scaly upper half gives them a bonus of +1 to Toughness against slashing and piercing weapons. They have gleaming green or gold eyes, a few of them may even have red eyes and there are a few cases where white scaled Sobeki are born, revered amongst their people.</p>"
"Spirit Interaction","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character can pay 1 Pulse as a free action to become dual-aligned for 1 Round so he affects both the spirit world and physical world simultaneously.</p>"
"Sunfire Conduit","Demigod","Edge - Weird","<p>The fury of the sun has been unleashed, right inside your demigod. His heart is molten to the core, his body several degrees hotter than it was before. Fire smolders behind his eyes and he can unleash bursts of plasma energy from his hands. By spending 2 Pulse he can create a damaging attack (Range: 12/14/48, Damage: 3d8, RoF: 1). Alternatively he can convert his power inside to the power of flight; 5 Pulse allows him to fly with a roaring cocoon of plasma energy surrounding his body. Flight lasts for half an hour per 5 Pulse used and he can move at 3x Pace per Round, climb at half his Pace rounded up.</p>"
"Telesma - Dimensional Pocket","Demigod, Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>The demigod’s Telesma has gained a mastery of Pulse creation; it can make a small pocket in the Maelstrom interconnected with the Telesma. For 5 Pulse, a demigod can place a single non-organic item in this “pocket”. The item can’t be longer than 6 feet or wider than 1 foot. The demigod can remove the item at any time for no cost, but must pay 5 Pulse again if he wishes to put it back.</p>"
"Telesma - Karma Bomb","Telesma, Demigod","Edge - Telesma","<p>For a single point of Karma, the Telesma can unleash hell on the demigod’s enemies, bursting from the spirit world into the physical world as a bright light causing damage to living tissue and all objects around the demigod. Friendly fire is possible — what do you expect for a Karma Nuke?</p><p>The use of this Edge creates a Large Burst Template centered on the demigod. It does Damage: 3d8 to all targets within the affected area with AP5. Additionally, all targets within the area are Shaken and take a level of Fatigue. Objects within the affected area must make a Toughness check as per the Savage Worlds rulebook.</p>"
"Telesma - Karma Chameleon","Telesma, Demigod","Edge - Telesma","<p>For a single point of Karma the demigod’s Telesma transforms him into a perfect replica of a being from the realm he’s in. It can replicate monstrous beings as well as robotic ones. It’s the ultimate form of shape-change and can fool even the most observant inhabitant of the realm. Of course, personality and mannerisms are another matter.</p><p>It can only change his appearance to a creature of the same size or up to 3 size categories larger, and while the effect is a physical one he gains no benefits (other than intimidation) from his increased size or any items or weapons the form appears to have. If the demigod moves into a different realm, the transformation is immediately undone; alternatively, the demigod may volunteer to undo the effect at any time.</p>"
"Telesma - Karma Regenerator","Telesma, Demigod","Edge - Telesma","<p>The demigod’s Telesma is so in tune with both Karma and the demigod that he automatically gains a point of Karma when his check dice and his Wild Die Ace at the same time. However, this isn’t like normal Karma; it’s stored in the Telesma for 24 hours until it dissipates. Only one point of Karma can be stored this way at any time. If a second point of Karma is added, it simply resets the clock for another 24 hours.</p>"
"Telesma Radio","Telesma","Edge- Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is capable of sending telepathic messages to other Telesmae in the same group as long as they’re in the same realm, without the need for line of sight. Note: If one Telesma gets this Edge, every Telesma in the group should get it!</p>"
"Telesma - Recall","Telesma, Demigod","Edge- Telesma","<p>Such a simple concept, but an important one for a Telesma attached to an item. The wielder can spend 2 Pulse to allow his Telesma to teleport the item back to his hand, even allowing a thrown weapon to return back to the thrower. This only works if the Telesma is incorporated into the item and works as long as the item and demigod are in the same realm.</p>"
"Telesma - Stolen Time","Telesma, Demigod","Edge - Telesma","<p>Got a minute, pal? The Telesma can take time and useit rather like a Karma flex (see S</p><p>avage Suzerain for more on those). It allows a demigod to act first in combat, avoid a single attack which might have killed him or store the time to save someone from a single event which might otherwise see them dead or worse.By expending 20 Pulse, the demigod can store a little time within his Telesma. The demigod disappears for five minutes, then reappears in the regular time stream. This time can then be used, within 24 hours, as a 1 Karma flex or as Karmic Influence (again, see <i>Savage Suzerain </i>for more on that).</p>"
"Thothari","Smarts d6+","Edge - Background, Racial\n\n","<p>One of the most reserved races in the Techno-Egyptian pantheon, the Thothari share their father’s features, having the body of a human but the upper shoulders and head of a long necked Ibis. They usually have an austere knowledgeable look about them, preferring long flowing robes and coats. They also dress in outfits with a lot of space to store cards, books and other things within. Thothari have an innate knack for anything requiring information, so they gain a bonus of +1 to all Knowledge rolls.</p><p><b>Knowledge Obscura: </b>Thothari can recall obscure facts they may have read days, weeks or months ago. In this case they can make a Smarts –4 check to recall an obscure fact relating to the current scene. They make great investigators; however they can only recall something from up to 48 hours ago.</p><p><b>Information Overdrive: </b>Thothari are quick to read a hologlyph book, snap through a database and leaf through the pages of a 600 page manuscript for data. They can reduce any time it takes to get information by half.</p>"
"Thothari: Improved","Heroic, Thothari, Smarts d8+","Edge- Racial","<p>The hero’s racial Edge improves in three ways: he now gains a +2 bonus instead of +1 in all Knowledge-based checks, he can now recall an obscure fact from a week ago as a Smarts –2 check (previously 48 hours and Smarts –4), and it now only takes a quarter of the time to get the information required from Information Overdrive</p>"
