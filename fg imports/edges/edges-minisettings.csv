"Arcane Background (Clergyman)","Novice","Background Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Faith (Spirit)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>3</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>10</p><p>Every town in the Colonies has at least one pastor, priest, or clergyman of faiths as varied as the countries from which Americans hail. Most of these consider arcane powers—even miracles— black magic, and the work of the devil. But a few channel power they believe emanates from the Creator. Call them saints, or “touched,” but they wield arcane strength with as much skill as any other practitioner, albeit with their religions’ trappings.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Runecaster)","Novice","Background Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Focus (Spirit)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>1</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>15</p><p>In Norse legend, Odin hung on a gallows for nine nights and was pierced by a spear to gain knowledge of the runes. He taught it to the Regin, and it filtered down to humanity through the ages. Runecasters have a carved rune token for each power they know. A power can still be cast if its rune is unavailable, but suffers a -2 modifier to the Focus roll. Runes must be engraved in solid material (preferably stone or ivory); they may not be written on paper or tattooed on the runecaster’s body. Lost runes may be recarved with 1d6 hours’ work and a successful Focus roll.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Scientifick Philosopher)","Novice","Background Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Weird Science (Smarts)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>2</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>15</p><p>The Age of Reason has brought science to the New World, and none embrace it more enthusiastically than Ben Franklin’s disciples in the League of Scientifick Philosophy. By 1786, the 80-year-old Ben Franklin is held in reverence second only to that afforded George Washington. Although his years of scientific innovation are long past, the League has kept the scientific method alive, optimizing the energies and principles established by Franklin. Many (but not all) members of the League are freemasons.</p><p><b>Arcane Devices: </b>Weird scientists automatically have the Artificer Edge, which allows them to create <b>Arcane Devices </b>. Indeed, they must always use devices for their powers.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Shaman)","Novice","Background Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Faith (Spirit)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>3</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>10</p><p>As long as there have been human beings, there have been those who are more in tune with the spirits of the plants and beasts, the seasons, the heavens, and the cycles of human physiology. These are the shamans, witch doctors, medicine men, and vodoun priests—those attuned to the barrier between the worlds, and to the world of light that lies beyond it.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Warlock)","Novice","Background Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Spellcasting (Smarts)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>3</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>10</p><p>The black magic of the Illuminati is not practiced by all its members. Indeed, many factions within the secret society shun or openly oppose such practices. But they do not oppose too vociferously, lest the warlocks take notice of them and pay a visit. Illuminati warlocks traffic with the souls of the dead. By tapping into the cold energies of purgatory, they are likewise able to manipulate their surroundings, much as a poltergeist would.</p>"
"Occultist","Novice, Occult d8+","Professional Edge","<p>In their quest to check the plots of the Regin, the Sons of Liberty often recruit those who know the ways of black magic and spirits. Those with this Edge have studied dark arts and strange entities for many years, learning their ways and how to defeat them.</p><p>Occultists get a free reroll on Occult rolls.</p>"

Many of these individuals are the sole source of knowledge for creating energy pistols and other weapons that makes use of Astla’s magic.</p><p><b>Arcane Devices: </b>Weird scientists automatically have the Artificer Edge, which allows them to create <b>Arcane Devices </b>. Indeed, they must <i>always </i>use devices for their powers.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Gifted Half-Born)","Novice, The Half-Born","Edge","<p><b>Arcane Skill: </b>Focus (Spirit)</p><p><b>Starting Powers: </b>1</p><p><b>Power Points: </b>15</p><p>Humans and Astlatians rarely mate, but when they do, their offspring occasionally exhibit incredible abilities. Not all half-elves are gifted, but all gifted are half-elves.</p><p>All gifted are creatures of both the cities and the woods, and their powers reflect it.</p>"

They use the energies of their dying world to warp the reality around them to their own desires. These powers are displayed by use of gestures, words, and runes that require many years of study to perfect.</p>"
"The Lost","Novice, Astlatian","Edge","<p>Those who suffer the affliction of the Wasting are immune to any and all mind-affecting powers due to the already damaged state of their minds. This includes <i>empathy, mind link, mind reading, mind wipe, puppet </i>, and any power with a mind-altering Trapping.</p><p>Those with the Wasting should also ensure one of their Hindrances is Death Wish, Driven, or a Vow to return to the place of their birth. Which one depends on their personality and how they seek to reconcile this intense and insatiable longing.</p>"
"Arcane Background (Galvanic Engineer)","Novice","Edge","<p>While the advancement of Victorian-era, steam-powered robots might seem like magic, it ain’t. At least not as the Tesla Rangers see it. The only Arcane Background available to players in this setting is a variation of Weird Science that folks call the Galvanic Engineer.</p><p>Galvanic Engineers are masters of the bleeding edge of Wired West technology. Constantly pushing the boundaries of the laws of science (and occasionally breaking them), Galvanic Engineers automatically have the Artificer Edge and must always use devices for their powers. Unless the inventor (or GM) decides otherwise, all damagedealing galvanic devices count as Heavy Weapons and should use Trappings like magnetism, electricity, steam, or vibration.</p><p><b>Galvanic Coils: </b>All Tesla Science devices run off a compact power source called a galvanic coil. Galvanic coils look something like a radio tube crackling with electrical energy. Starting inventors have three coils, and each coil holds 5 Power Points. Each device must have one or more available coils to function. Swapping charged coils from one device to another is an action.</p><p><b>Recharging: </b>Galvanic Engineers recharge their coils by attaching them to a Teslic Dynamo—a device about the size of a toaster that collects electrical energy passively from the Earth’s magnetic field. Teslic dynamos generate 5 Power Points per hour in the wilderness, or every 15 minutes when within 100 yards of a Tesla tower. Dynamos can also be used to transfer power points between coils (See <b>Tinkering </b>in <i>Savage Worlds </i>).</p><p><b>Malfunctions: </b>If a character rolls a Critical Failure when using a device, it Malfunctions. All of the device’s active powers terminate instantly and it loses 1d4 of its remaining Power Points, spread out evenly across attached coils.</p><p>Coils can be targeted with a Called Shot (-4) and have an equivalent Toughness of 4 if hit. Shaking a coil generates the same effect as a Malfunction. A Wound causes it to overload and explode in a Medium Burst Template, inflicting 1d6 electrical damage for each charge the coil still holds. Safety measures ensure that an overload is not instantaneous, however, so this explosion is subject to <b>Evasion </b>(see <i>Savage Worlds </i>). Alternatively, a character can attempt to toss the device away: Use the same rules as Evasion but substitute Athletics (throwing) for Agility. If successful, the hero can move the center of the blast 1d6" in a direction of their choice (2d6" with a raise).</p>"
"Journeyman Tinkerer","Novice, Smarts d8+, Repair d6+","Edge","<p>An hour of tinkering with a weapon lets you make a Repair roll and add one of the following bonuses with a success, or two with a raise: +1 Damage, +1 to hit, +1 AP, +1 RoF, +1 Parry, +1 Reach, or +5 base Range. This effect lasts for 48 hours or until a player rolls a 1 on a skill die to use the weapon, at which point the weapon returns to normal operation. Each bonus can only be taken once. Subsequent tinkering removes any prior effects.</p>"
