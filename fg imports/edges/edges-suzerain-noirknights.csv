Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Hail Of Bullets","Seasoned, Shooting d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>This is the art of unloading a clip in a crowded restaurant and not hitting a single innocent bystander. Your character may pay 1 Pulse if he rolls a 1 (or 2 if using a weapon with full-auto fire or a shotgun) to make sure he doesn’t hit innocent bystanders. It’s the hero’s choice of a whiter-than-white government agent… and a few villains who like to maintain a ‘bad boy folk hero’ status among the general public. You can find innocent bystander rules in the Savage Worlds rule book.</p>"
"Just As Planned","Novice, Lucky","Edge - Weird","<p>Your character has a back-up plan or surprise turnaround for even the most outlandish circumstances. Once per gaming session, he is able to turn a situational penalty into a bonus by spending 5 Pulse. For example, Frank Delaney is wrestling a rabid dust devil when his opponent throws sand in his eyes. Luckily, Frank has trained hard for this day – instead of receiving a –2 penalty to all physical actions requiring sight, he takes advantage of his opponent’s overconfidence and receives a +2 bonus instead.</p>"
"Lucky Guess","Novice, Lucky, Smarts d6+","Edge - Weird","<p>Impersonation can be a difficult task. One tiny slip can tip people off to the ruse. Your character has a knack for filling in the right details. He can guess the proper penal code designation to describe a crime when pretending to be a police officer, or prescribe the correct drug when posing as a doctor. Impersonating specific people can be much more difficult, since particulars about a person’s life are harder to guess. Whenever the character is dealing with an NPC, he may spend 3 Pulse and make a Smarts Check. With a success, he correctly guesses the information he needs, giving him a +2 bonus to any social checks with the character he’s fooled for the remainder of the scene. The GM should make certain bits of information more difficult to guess, and intuiting some facts may be impossible. Lucky Guess should be used in the moment and generally during the course of a conversation with someone whom the character is trying to fool.</p>"
"Nothing To See Here","Seasoned, Spirit d6+, Persuasion\nd8+","Edge - Weird","<p>Whether through iron nerves or a federally-issued lawman’s badge, your character can easily convince others that he’s doing exactly what he’s supposed to be doing, whatever that may be, so they leave him alone. Activating this Edge can only be done outside of combat, costs 5 Pulse, and lasts for the duration of the scene. During this time, Extras shuffle about their daily business, ignoring whatever your character’s up to (as long as it doesn’t directly affect them). Wild Cards get a Spirit check, with failure having the same result. Observers who try later to recall what your character was doing get a –4 penalty to their Smarts check.</p>"
"Pulse Path - Railwalker","Enabled, Survival d8+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialist)","<p>The railwalkers aren’t really a society. They might never have been, and they certainly aren’t now. There’s no official structure and its members are scattered and isolated. Some would say they haven’t really gone into hiding. It’s just that the more reclusive railwalkers weren’t hunted down. Droop might still be around somewhere, but Hanly is confirmed history. Today, surviving railwalkers are careful to go unnoticed. Even when meeting another of their kind, they check a couple times, maybe tracing a sigil in the air or asking a question about Hanly before invoking the Res ex Gratia.</p><p>On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Invoke Code (Agility) d4</p><p>Two sigils from the following list of new Powers: Bolt The Door, Good Luck, Hidden Stash, Little Slice O’ Heaven, Mean Dog, Worth Robbing.</p><p>Method In The Magic:</p><p>Except as outlined below, the railwalker’s invocation works exactly as any other Scribe check used by an Enabled character (see Savage Suzerain page 36).Commonly scrawled in coal or chalk, sigils are rough icons, with a scant resemblance to their meanings. They were, after all, intended to hide their message, while still bearing a mnemonic element for those in the know. Creating a sigil is simple and yields powerful results, a part of magic that’s also a part of the railwalker in a very physical way. Each sigil strains and the Pulse needs to be wrestled into existence, held and shaped to make the mystical forms that yield the desired results. There are few weak railwalkers; under their rags, they almost all keep the strong, wiry frame of a prizefighter. Not to protect themselves against the bulls (though it’s good for that too), but to shape the magic.</p><p>Invoking the code takes time and physical components. Aside from normal writing utensils, railwalkers can carve, chisel, burn, use a stick in the dirt, pee in the snow, dig a series of trenches, or use just about anything to make a symbol of the proper shape and proportions. The size makes no difference in the sigil’s potency, but larger sigils may draw unwanted attention. Be that as it may, railwalkers sometimes refer to the railroad as ‘The Great Sigil’.</p><p>Sketching a sigil can be done quickly. However, concentrating Pulse to activate it is a more onerous time sink. The process normally lasts a full minute, but can be reduced to a Round by spending twice the normal Pulse. When creating a sigil the slow way, it’s still possible to perform other actions (as long as the character can keep sketching), but the character’s Invoke Code roll will suffer the -2 Multi- Action Penalty. Finishing in a few seconds requires total concentration, and cannot be combined with any other action, speaking, walking, or otherwise. It should also be noted that the extra Pulse spent in doing a quick sketch will recover at the normal rate, although the amount actually needed to fuel the sigil will remain ‘spent’ until the sigil is used up or cancelled. For some sigils that happens immediately the code is invoked (those with an ‘instant’ duration). Others last a short duration, then the sigil’s power is used up. Some have an effect until they’re cancelled… at the will of its creator or by his death!</p><p>Some railwalkers joke that they have a one track mind. It sounds good because of the railroad allusion, but they’re really talking about a quirk of their powers. It is impossible for a railwalker to have more than one instance of the same sigil active at a time. The Hidden Stash sigil and the Worth Robbing sigil work fine together, but inscribing a second Hidden Stash sigil will cancel the effects of the first.</p>"
"Pulse Path - Ruizologist","Gifted, Repair d8+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialist)","<p>The methods of ruizologists are academic, but they’re agrarians at heart, tied to the land and the weather by their gizmos and arcane-infused inventions. After learning their trade in secret lectures at Florida State University, they generally return home to work their farms and build their communities. Bertrand Ruiz was a successful farmer and professor, but he was an adventurer too. That is to say, a few ruizologists take to the road. And when they do, Henry Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture, is very keen to hire wayfaring ruizologists into the United States Department of Agriculture… if the SPA doesn’t recruit them first!</p><p>Ruizologists can come from anywhere in the gamut of backgrounds: a simple farm hand who learned to read and write; an adventurous professor with a whip and a fedora; a graceless boor with a trust fund; or an awkward bookworm with deep-set scruples. Working with other characters, a ruizologist tends to take on the role of an ostentatious problem solver and occasionally a jack-of-all-trades. On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Ruizology</p><p>(Smarts) d4Two spells from the following list of new Powers: Augur, Bolt From The Blue, Rainbow Walk, Refraction Breach, Squall, Weather Working.</p><p>Rain Maker:</p><p>Of course, it’s harder than it looks. Careful preparations and precise calculations must be applied if a ruizologist wishes to effect one of his astounding displays. This isn’t exactly magic. It’s magic and science, and science is easier with the proper tools. Each of a ruizologist’s Powers is enhanced by using a Spell Engine which the ruizologist can activate at any time as part of his spellcasting action. With a Spell Engine, a ruizologist gets +2 to his checks when casting the linked spell, but without one he gets a -2 penalty instead. A superior Engine adds +3 for that particular spell, rather than +2.To build a Spell Engine he’ll need pieces and parts he finds in the local hardware store, costing $10 per point of Pulse the spell uses and needing his Repair Skill to determine success, with a penalty equal to the Pulse the spell uses. Get a Raise, and the Engine is a superior version. This process takes a number of hours equal to the Pulse the spell uses, and a failed Repair check ruins the parts and wastes the time. A character starting out as a ruizologist is assumed to already have Engines for any of his ruizology spells (but not superior versions).</p><p>Ruizologists may still use other spells (ones that aren’t part of his specialization) in the normal manner. Those are still ‘science’ as far as the character is concerned, the precise calculation of Pulse manipulation, but they look and act like magic to everyone else’s thinking.</p>"
"Pulse Path - - Taximancer","Empowered, Healing d8+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialist)","<p>The past two centuries have been good to the Filial Order of St. James. Its grisly origins have been forgotten by all but a few incredulous historians. And the South has tolerated the Order’s growth and propagation across several states. Naturally, their methods and beliefs have tempered considerably since the days of Toussaint and Tock. Only a very few practice taximancy, and those few are sure to keep it out of sight or obscure the true mainspring of their miraculous clockwork.</p><p>The Order has permanent churches in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, but its preachers, missions, and revivals reach the entire southern United States, as far north as Delaware, and as far west as Texas. Sermons often extol the virtues of self-expression through physical media, such as painting, sculpture, entomological collections, leather tanning, and dissection. And services usually culminate in a sacramental, hands-on healing session, either purely through prayer or occasionally through a taximancer’s well-concealed art.</p><p>The Order believes that selfish greed is the only sin, but that it takes many forms. Be it pride, lust, or wrath, the desire to outgrow your place in God’s creation is always the cause. Redemption comes from prayer, confession, repentance, and art. Although not selfless to the point of self destruction, members of the Order aspire to be humble believers in the miraculous and the divine.</p><p>On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Taximancy (Spirit) d4</p><p>Two prayers from the following list of new Powers: Blood To Wine, Bondye’s Boon, Drudge, Filial Drudgery, Loa’s Blessing, Purgatory.</p><p>The Spirits That Ride:</p><p>Toussaint was once a priest in Haiti, and carried many of his beliefs into the new religion that he founded with Tock. Bondye is technically the Order’s only god, however there are many lesser gods or local saints, who are known to aid humans on Bondye’s behalf. These saints are called Loa, and their aid is requested whenever a taximancer takes part in the holy process of creation. Which Loa the taximancer prays to depends on what power he wishes to give his creation.Dealing with the Loa is a dangerous pastime, however – especially for those who are grounded in the realm of the physical. While they are not evil, they do have their own motives, and their actions may therefore appear capricious to mortal men. And while they are willing to do a service in return for the chance to drink of some extra Pulse, they may not always wish to play the servant’s role. In fact, ‘riding’ a physical vessel is something that the Loa are fond of doing – that is, share or taking control of a physical vessel for a time, so that they may enjoy interacting with the physical world.</p><p>In game terms what this means is that any time a character rolls a ‘1’ on his Taximancy die, the prayer fails and the Loa rides him for the rest of the scene, becoming a passenger in the character’s body. A little of the Loa’s more extreme personality quirks rub off on the taximancer – till the end of the scene he gains a major psychological Hindrance of the GMs choosing. Whether that’s a phobia, delusion, death wish, or sudden bout of pacifism, it should be something that’s likely to be relevant to that scene.</p>"
"Sharp Shooter","Seasoned, Shooting d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>Your character has the knack for picking off the villain who’s holding the hostage in front of him as a human shield. He gets a +1 bonus toward offsetting a Called Shot penalty when making a Shooting roll. He may also pay Pulse before making the attack roll to offset more of a Called Shot penalty at a cost of 2 Pulse per point of bonus.</p>"
"Soul Of Lincoln","Novice, Charisma +2 or more,\nSpirit d8+","Edge - Social","<p>Your character’s morals were conceived in liberty and he is a champion of the downtrodden. His speech has, on occasion, moved even the hardest hearts to nobly advance toward empathy. He gains +2 to Persuasion rolls, or +4 if he’s arguing for the rights and well-being of a particular social group (so ‘the poor’, ‘new immigrants’ or ‘accountants’ are fine but ‘people who are tied up in the corner of this room right now’ doesn’t get the +4). To get the bonus, your character and the heroes he’s adventuring with can’t stand to benefit from his oratory – this is altruistic stuff where the benefit is a warm fuzzy feeling inside, and the main beneficiaries have to be other folks. If it’s innocent townspeople who are tied up in the corner of the room, your character can probably argue to get them released and get +2 to the roll. If it’s the other characters who are tied up – no dice.</p>"
"Telesma-Allure","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is sexy, convincing or some combination of the two. This benefit is shared telepathically, granting your character +1 Charisma.</p>"
"Telesma - Assistant","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can concentrate on maintaining his magic Powers for him, reducing the concentration penalty by 1 per Telesma rank. It also grants +2 to checks made to keep Powers going when your character suffers damage.</p>"
"Telesma -Attribute Synergy","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is particularly adept in one of the five core Attributes and able to guide and influence the same Attribute in your character, increasing his Wild Die one step when rolling that Attribute. This option can be taken multiple times, applying to a new Attribute each time.</p>"
"Telesma - Balm","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can soothe his Fatigue, reducing the Fatigue track by a single level once per day.</p>"
"Telesma - Forced Manifestation","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma can trick, tear, or finagle spirits into the physical world. This causes the targeted spirit to become dual-aligned (see page 11). Doing so costs your character 5 Pulse. This effect lasts for five Rounds, and can be extended another 5 Rounds by paying an extra 5 Pulse.</p>"
"Telesma - Karma Bank","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character may store 1 unspent Karma at the end of a session. This may be used in later sessions. The bank can hold only 1 Karma at any given time.</p>"
"Telesma-Protective","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma emits a protective field of Pulse around his physical body shielding him from harm. This grants your character +1 Toughness.</p>"
"Telesma - Psychically Aggressive","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Taunt and Intimidation checks can Incapacitate opponents thanks to the assistance of his Telesma in the spirit world.</p>"
"Telesma - Pulse Battery","Telesma","Edge","<p>Your character’s Telesma acts as a battery containing 1 Pulse per rank of the Telesma. This replenishes every 24 hours. This option may be taken multiple times, each time increasing the Pulse per rank by 1.</p>"
"Telesma - Spirit Interaction","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character can pay 1 Pulse as a free action to become dual-aligned for 1 Round so he affects both the spirit world and physical world simultaneously.</p>"
"Telesma - Spirit Sense","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is much more sensitive to the spirit world around itself. It can sense spirits and other strong Pulse sources, even if they’re not in its line of sight. This works up to a hundred yards distance with a vague idea of what sort of Pulse source they are (a raven spirit, for instance, or a portal to the Maelstrom). It then communicates this information back to its master – assuming they’re on speaking terms. This Edge may be taken a second time, increasing the range to a mile and giving the Telesma an idea of how powerful the spirits are, too. This finely honed sense only works in the spirit world – if a spirit is manifested in the physical world, for instance, your character’s Telesma will be blissfully unaware. And it doesn’t work in the Maelstrom either, where sensory overload would surely result if it concentrated on all the spirits around!</p>"
"Telesma - Telesma Radio","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma is capable of sending telepathic messages to other Telesmae in the same group as long as they’re in the same realm, without the need for line of sight. Note: If one Telesma gets this Edge, every Telesma in the group should get it!</p>"
"Telesma - Ward","Telesma","Edge - Telesma","<p>Your character’s Telesma maintains protective wards to stave off harmful magic and malign spirits. Enemies get -1 to their roll if they target your character with a Pulse-fuelled action (any action with a Pulse cost associated with it). This Telesma Edge may be taken.</p>"
"Unreliable Narrator","Heroic, Spirit d8+, Persuasion\nd8+","Edge - Weird","<p>It’s said that the finest actors of ancient Greece could entrance their audience and guide them to whatever ends the playwright had devised. Tales told around the campfire engage attention to horrifying conclusions, and hypnotists claim to utilize this state of conscious dreams for countless purposes. Your character may spend 3 Pulse to make an opposed roll between his Persuasion Skill and the Spirit of his audience (or the highest Spirit, if there are multiple values). If your character wins, the audience is enthralled, and must continue to listen, mostly unaware of anything else present in their surroundings – making them inactive guards for purposes of Stealth and giving them a -4 penalty to any Notice rolls they might make. This effect lasts for one minute, although the character may spend 3 Pulse to continue for an additional minute. He may keep this up for as long as desired. Only extreme elements in the environment, such as imminent personal danger, will allow the audience to attempt another opposed check to break the effect.</p>"
