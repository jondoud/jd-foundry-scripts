Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"Djinn","Novice","Edge - Racial","<p>During the Pulse War, six races were created by fusing human DNA with elemental matter. The djinn are the race of air elementals. Even when not transformed (see below), a djinni shows its heritage by being a mass of blue swirling cloud in a human shape. They can make the cloud thick and solid, something they often do on the face and hands, whereas it’s slightly spongy elsewhere.</p>"
"Persona","Novice","Edge - Racial","<p>A fusion of human DNA with the opposed Pulse elements of Essence and Resonance, personas are average in every way for the culture they’re in - average height, weight, skin color, and so on. However, these extremely rare people can do a couple of remarkable things:</p><p/><p>First, a persona can channel their Pulse to shift their physical appearance, including gendershifting and some change in size, muscle tone, etc.</p><p/><p>Second, a persona can split duplicates of themselves out from their body. These duplicates and the main body share a consciousness but can act independently for a short period of time, then they dissipate into the spirit world and are gone. While duplicates may think exactly alike, they are not mind linked.</p>"
