"Aos Sidhe","Agility d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Aos sidhe are the lords of the Fey Realm of Dreams - picture elves but make them taller and much more formal. All aos sidhe start play with the Edges and Hindrances below.</p><p>Edge:</p><p>Connections. This can be due to the great houses’ patronage of others or just people your adventurer used his position to help. Whatever the reason, your adventurer starts with the Connections Edge for a group of your choice for free.Hindrance:</p><p>Realm Bound. Your adventurer finds it physically traumatic leaving Mechadia. He suffers 2 levels of Fatigue when first going through one of the portals that dot the landscape, visiting via dreams or even when getting swept away by a dreamstorm. Interestingly, he doesn’t have any such problems when crossing the Veil as a Heroic character, using the normal method most Suzerain heroes use (see Savage Suzerain for more on that). It must be something about Mechadia itself.Hindrance:</p><p>Iron Allergy (minor). As an aos sidhe your adventurer is closer linked to the fey of the Fey Realm of Dreams than most, and suffers their traditional allergy to iron. If you want, you can choose to upgrade this to a major Hindrance at character creation - it will count as if you’d taken a new minor Hindrance instead.</p><p><b><i>Ruarc (Torridaen)</i></b></p><p>Special Abilities• Weather Control: Your adventurer has the ability to direct his Pulse in a way that can affect the weather. It costs 3 Pulse to attempt and requires a successful Spirit roll to make a small change, and a Success with a Raise to make a big change. A small change would be to stop or start it raining when the sky is overcast. A big change would be to bring in storm clouds on a sunny day. Small chnages can happen quite quickly, big changes can take up to 30 minutes to take effect.</p><p>• Electrical Affinity: Any electrical damage your adventurer takes is reduced by 1 point and he gains a +2 on any checks to resist electrical effects.</p><p>• Wanderlust: Your adventurer cannot start with Noble or Rich Edges and similar effects gained in play cannot be held for extended periods.</p>"
"Armiger","Novice, Agility d6+, Strength d6+","Edge - Combat","<p>The character is well trained at fighting in armor. Reduce your armor’s penalty to your Parry by 1.</p>"
"Catlike Reflexes","Seasoned, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+, Notice d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>The character is skilled enough to counter multiple attackers at once. When fighting multiple opponents, your enemies never gain any “gang up” bonuses against you.</p>"
"Goblin","Smarts d6, Invention d6","Edge - Background, Racial","<p>Special Abilities</p><p>• Jury-Rig: Goblins are able to very quickly cobble together gadgets and tools that work for a limited time before falling apart. The goblin declares what they want to build and the GM assigns any suitable bonuses or penalties, like -2 for no tools or -2 due to the complexity of an item. The goblin then spends 10 minutes and makes an Invention roll, applying the modifiers if any. If he succeeds, he gets an item that will work for one or two uses; with a Raise it will last a bit longer, maybe as many as four uses before falling apart or ceasing to work. Jury-Rigged items rarely hang together more than a day and never work quite as well as things produced through proper Invention.</p><p>• Rat-Squirm: Goblins start with the Rat-Squirm Edge.</p><p>• Claws: Goblins can use their natural claws as weapons (Damage: Str+d4).</p><p>• Unreliable Work: Goblin inventions that are not Jury-Rigged can still be quite unreliable, every time one is used if the dice roll (ignoring wild dice) comes up a 1 the item does not work.</p><p>• Small: Due to their small frame goblins suffer -1 Toughness.</p>"
"Haffuns","","Edge - Racial","<p>Small: Haffuns have Size–1 and –1m Toughness.</p><p>• Quiet (Talda): Every haff un starts with a free d6 in Stealth.</p><p>• Servant’s Ear: Haffuns stay quiet partly so they can hear more. Th ey get +2 on Notice rolls based on listening.</p><p>• Sympathetic Ear: Haffuns excel at</p><p>communicating with others. If a haffun can take a full minute to work with an intelligent creature with no common language, he can attempt to understand and get across basic concepts at an eff ective language skill of d4–2. Th e creature must not have a Hostile or Uncooperative Reaction level and each important idea requires a separate roll. The GM can award up to +2 on each roll for excellent roleplaying of the communication attempt.</p><p>• Family Membership: Each haffun character is part of a family with its own special skills and benefi ts. See below.</p><p>• Giving Curse (ghuva): Haff uns are mystically bound to help other intelligent beings in need. If another person looks in the haffun’s eyes and concentrates for five seconds, the haff un learns that person’s current desire and must try to accomplish it. Th e haffun suff ers –1 on all trait tests until the desire is fulfilled or the person dies. Powers such as dispel do not aff ect the curse, and a haffun tasked with a desire would not even try to have it counteracted. Only one task can aff ect a haff un at a time; other ghuva attempts fail until the first is completed.</p><p>• Among Us: Haffuns exist within human society. Like humans, they start with one free Novice Edge.</p>"
"Harrying Attack","Veteran, Agility d8+, Fighting d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>This Edge is a running attack that allows your character to attack a foe as she moves past.

"Iron Bound Elves","","Edge - Racial","<p>• <b>Shade Eyes: </b>Elves live under heavy foliage and have Low Light Vision.</p><p>• <b>Photosynthetic </b>: Elves are closely related to the Great Trees, and they derive sustenance from the light of the sun. An elf who spends at least six hours in sunlight does not need to eat food that day. He still needs water.</p><p>• <b>Iron Curse </b>: From a time before history, elves have suffered from a mystical vulnerability to iron bonds. In an hour-long ritual, known to some NPCs, an iron band can be fi xed around an elf ’s ankle, wrist, or neck. Th is makes the elf “iron bound” (cwthellean) and forces him to glumly obey the orders of the one who bound him. The elf cannot attack or oppose the binder, nor try to escape, and any time the binder gives a command, the elf must win a contest of Spirit or promptly obey. Even if he resists, his master can just give the order again. The binder can transfer ownership to a new master by reciting a ritual set of orders. Iron bound elves wither and die quickly; each has only 1d6+6 years to live once the band goes on. See below for ways to overcome the curse.</p><p>• Heritage: An elf comes from one of two social backgrounds: Tree bound (cyff athellean) or soil bound (cyllabellan.) Each provides a particular ability equivalent to one free Edge.</p><p>Elves of both tree bound and soil bound origin can fall under the Iron Curse. Th e iron band around an enslaved elf ’s neck or limb cannot be removed by ordinary means. If it were destroyed or forced off without the curse fi rst being broken, the elf would die. Th ere are only a few ways out of the iron curse: becoming a Dark Elf, achieving the near-mythical Heart Bond, or gaining the help of the probably imaginary Iron Biters.</p><p><b>Iron Biters: </b>Rumors persist of a group of elves that know a secret ritual to reverse the eff ect of binding. Whether this is true falls into the purview of the GM.</p><p><b>Heart Bond: </b>If two iron bound elves choose each other as lifetime mates, there is a ritual known to a few formerly iron bound elves that transforms the binding to one of the heart, ending the curse. Both elves must take them Common Bond Edge at the same time, which requires a Spirit of d8, although an NPC need not be a Wild Card. Alternatively, a Legendary elf can form a Heart Bond with any one iron bound elf by taking the Sidekick Edge.</p><p><b>Dark Elves: </b>An iron bound elf can overcome his enslavement by selling his soul to the dark powers. He then becomes a durzhah: a Dark Elf, with the Arcane Background (Dark Elf.)</p>"

"Pulse Path - Teslamancy","Enabled, Agility d6+","Edge - Pulse Path (Specialist)","<p>An adventurer with Teslamancy feels an innate connection to the intoxicating energy of invention, including, but not limited to, electricity. He can manipulate energy currents of mechanics and magic in various ways linked to the spirit of Mechadian technology. In doing so, a Telesmancer is creating mystic sigils from wires and circuits, cogs and gyros. These imbue him with a scrivener’s power over the energy of machines and of their invention, which the great Tesla himself would surely have approved of.
