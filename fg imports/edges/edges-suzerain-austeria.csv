Name,Requirements,Type,Benefit
"House Gift (House Vesper)","Novice, Aristocrat","Edge - Background","<p>Although not every noble has the gift of their House, many inner members of a House do, having begun training with it from a young age. After all, the gifts have been passed on from generation to generation, and reflect the philosophies, values and leadership techniques of each of the noble houses. For House Vesper, the gift is all about knowledge.</p><p/><p>Magpie Mind: When knowledge is the currency of the land, its rulers must understand a vast array of subjects. Magpie Mind grants an absurd amount of trivia about almost anything there is to know. Learned through a combination of study, discussion and social osmosis, this storehouse of information comes through at the strangest times.Your hero gains a +1 bonus to Common Knowledge, and also may use the Jack Of All Trades Edge on any Smarts-based Skill. This extends to knowledge of other Skills as well - a Vesper noble may know nothing about boating or fighting, but can likely discuss boats and swords at great length.</p>"
"House Knight","Novice, Fighting d8+, Riding d8+","Edge - Social","<p>House knights are the bottom rung on the nobility ladder. Your hero is a member of a noble household and has certain bonus items at their disposal. In exchange for service to the Lord, a House knight is given a long sword, a plate corselet embossed with the livery of the House, and a medium shield.</p><p>Access is also given to a horse, if necessary. A House knight receives a +2 Persuasion bonus when dealing with Caladonian common folk (including other knights), but not with any other nobles or elevated commoners (such as guild masters).</p>"
"House Spy","Novice, Notice d8+, Persuasion d6+, Stealth d8+, Thievery d6+","Edge - Professional","<p>Every House wants to know what the other Houses are up to. To that end, almost all of them have been known to either recruit or employ House spies. These individuals are notorious for picking up on the little things, getting into places they aren’t wanted, and calmly talking their way back out. With the coming of the Wild, House spies are more useful than ever - information about the Warlock armies could decide the war.</p><p>A House spy gains a +2 Persuasion bonus, as well as a +2 to any Notice and Stealth rolls – although the Stealth bonus only applies in urban settings, not in the wilderness.</p>"
"Nobody","Novice, No Hindrances that make your adventurer distinctive such as Attractive, Ugly, or One Arm.","Edge - Weird","<p>Some people are naturally able to blend into a crowd, to be ignored or overlooked even when standing alone. This Edge gives your hero the ability to be instantly forgettable, average, nobody worth remembering. This can be a great boon in many social or combat situations and gives +2 to Stealth and Persuasion checks where being less than memorable would be advantageous.</p>"
"Rapid Shot","Seasoned, skill with chosen weapon type of d8+","Edge - Combat","<p>This Edge functions like the Rapid Fire Edge in the Savage Worlds core rulebook, but for non-firearm ranged weapons such as bows (Shooting) or knives (Athletics - throwing). It doesn’t work with weapons which require a full action to reload, or for large thrown weapons such as javelins.</p><p>Your hero can take this Edge a second time, applying it to the other type of weapon. Just like Improved Rapid Fire, there is an equivalent Edge called Improved Rapid Shot, which works in exactly the same way, but for non-firearm ranged weapons.</p>"
"Wolfen","Novice","Edge - Racial","<p>• Hybrid Form: Wolfen gain +1 size, and +1 Strength die step (this may exceed maximum).</p><p>• Brawn: Wolfen are powerful physical specimens, beginning with d6 Vigor, and maximum cap of d12+1, but -1 Smarts (but not its linked skills).</p><p>• Claws: Wolfen in hybrid form have claws. These count as a weapon and deal Str+d4 damage. Unfortunately they tend to get in the way of fine manipulation, and any Action requiring manual dexterity (including wielding other weapons) is at -2.</p><p>• Regenerate: Wolfen can regenerate wounds while in their hybrid form. Five minutes after having sustained an injury, a wolfen can make a natural healing roll. In the case of multiple wounds inflicted close together, such as during combat, make a single check five minutes after the fracas. This effect cannot bring a wolfen back from the dead.</p><p>• Transformation: This is a Free action costing 3 Pulse and lasts 1 hour which can be maintained by paying 2 Pulse per hour to extend the duration. Pulse expended on the transformation does not recharge while transformed.</p>"
