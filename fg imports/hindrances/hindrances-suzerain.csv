Name,Major,Type,Benefit
"Standing Orders",false,"Hindrance - minor","<p>While your adventurer may have his own goals, he ultimately serves another power and is expected to follow orders when they are issued. An adventurer with this Hindrance may be a knight or spy, a contracted mercenary, a guild mage, or a Trinity crusader, for example.</p>"
"Doomed (Major or Minor)",true,"Hindrance","<p>Have you stolen from any gods lately? Born on cursed ground in the middle of a thunderstorm? Decided that a secret, universal truth is just a 'harmless superstition?' If you've answered yes to one or more of these questions, you may be doomed.</p><p>As a minor Hindrance this gives the GM one additional Karma each session to add to her general Karma pool. As a major, the GM gets two additional Karma. This Karma should be used against the character with this Hindrance, making his life less comfortable in fun and interesting ways. Remember, the gods of Fate tend to have the wickedest sense of humor.</p>"

"Achilles Heel (Minor)",false,"Hindrance","<p>Whether it has been foretold by oracles, is the result of a curse, or a simple physical flaw, the character has a weak spot that will one day be the source of his demise. The exact location may be chosen by the player, and is considered a critical location (requiring a called shot with a -4 penalty to hit, +4 to damage/+8 if the location is already considered a critical location, i.e. head, neck, heart, etc). The character cannot use Karma to Soak damage caused to this location.</p>"
"Hades Wants You (Major)",true,"Hindrance","<p>Your character believes he has drawn the unwanted attention of the invisible lord of the underworld. Such attention can be deadly. All Soak rolls and rolls to avoid death are at -2 (see Incapacitation in the Savage Worlds rule book). The character cannot take the Hard to Kill or Harder to Kill Edges.</p>"
"No Sense Of Humor",false,"Hindrance","<p>The Logician gains the Hindrance of the same name. Note that two Logicians talking together do not suffer -2 Charisma towards each other due to this Hindrance, though they still can’t tell a decent joke.</p>"
"Sense of Duty (Minor)",false,"Hindrance","<p>This Hindrance is similar to loyal except it is linked to a polis rather than a group of people or friends. Note that the sense of duty is to a polis and its people, not necessarily towards any given leader. Patriots who believed they acted in the best interests of their home and people have initiated many rebellions.</p>"
"Iron Allergy (Major or Minor)",true,"Hindrance","<p>There’s a lot of iron in Mechadia due to the influence of technology, but your adventurer’s biology hearkens back to the Fey Realm of Dreams and contact with any object made of iron gives him a rash at best, Wounds at worst. As a minor Hindrance you suffer a -2 to all rolls while he’s in contact with iron. As a major Hindrance you suffer the -2 penalty and take a Wound if his bare flesh touches iron for more than a second or two. If struck by an iron weapon your adventurer would not suffer an additional Wound, but if he picked up iron in his bare hand he would take a Wound.</p>"
"Realm Bound (Major)",true,"Hindrance","<p>Your adventurer finds it physically traumatic leaving Mechadia. He suffers 2 levels of Fatigue when first going through one of the portals that dot the landscape, visiting via dreams or even when getting swept away by a dreamstorm. Interestingly, he doesn’t have any such problems when crossing the Veil as a Heroic character, using the normal method most Suzerain heroes use (see Savage Suzerain for more on that). It must be something about Mechadia itself.</p>"
"Talisman",false,"Hindrance","<p>Like a shaman, each skinwalker has a talisman that gives her power. In the skinwalker’s case, this talisman is always an animal skin or a cloak of feathers from the animal they can transform into. If the talisman is lost, the skinwalker cannot use her Shapechanger ability until her talisman is recovered. Should a skinwalker’s talisman be destroyed, she must succeed on a Vigor roll or immediately suffer a level of fatigue, which may be recovered after 24 hours. A skinwalker may replace a destroyed talisman by obtaining a new skin or feathered cloak of the specified animal type and conducting a bonding ritual that lasts 24 hours and requires a Spirit roll at -2. The skinwalker gains a +1 bonus to the Spirit roll for every additional day she spends performing the ritual. If the Spirit roll is failed, the skinwalker may make another attempt on the following day.</p>"
"Magical Vulnerability (Major or Minor)",true,"Hindrance","<p>Your character has some problem with magic, especially when bad spells are thrown his way. Whatever the effect, it’s doubled for the minor version, or tripled for the major. If it’s a damaging attack then it’s going to seriously hurt. And for positive magic, the effect is halved (minor) or a third of the usual effect (major).</p>"
