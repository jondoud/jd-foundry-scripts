He’s certainly a dab hand with Ra’s Hard-light tech and this is exactly what he does. He works in the Hypertech Corporation as the head of Ra’s Research and Development division and gives new projects the once-over. He appears as an elderly man, dark skinned with short graying hair (including a close cut grey beard) and has a deep sonorous voice. He wears a crisp white suit with gold trim and you’ll never see him without a tech-spanner or some form of tool close to hand. The hero gets one of these abilities when he first takes the Edge, another at Demigod rank. If he takes the Edge when he’s at Demigod rank, he gets two abilities immediately:</p><p><b>Creation Of Ptah: </b>With a single spoken word, usually translated from a hologlyph — the hero can bring into being an inanimate object, even one as complex as a firearm. There’s one limit: nothing bigger than you can easily carry in two hands. A bicycle, a gun, a fancy bottle of wine... those are all fine. The complexity of the item determines the Pulse cost — a very simple item costs 1 Pulse whereas something with complex moving parts like a gun, or complex chemicals (explosives or acid for instance), is a 3 Pulse cost. Nuclear bombs and Hardlight tech are too complex to make with this Power. Once created the item lasts for 4 Rounds, but can be maintained by paying the Pulse cost again for another 4 Rounds of use. And no, the hero can’t create “the key to that vault” unless he already knows exactly what the key should look like. Nice try.</p><p><b>Crafter’s Zone: </b>Does the hero need a quiet place to work, a toolshed to make an awesome death-dealing device of ultimate destruction? Never fear, this is where Ptah gives him the ability to summon a portable workstation, replete with all the Hard-light tools he’d ever need and even a storage space for materials. For 1 Pulse the hero gains access to a workshop with all the tools needed for his current task, giving him a +2 to Repair or appropriate skill checks. The workshop lasts for 6 hours or until the task is complete, whichever comes first.</p><p><b>How It Works: </b>The hero gains a full insight into an inanimate object he touches. He knows how it was made, the steps of its construction and how to take it apart if need be. Note, this does not work on something as complex as the whole Osiris ship, but can be used on individual systems. The hero pays 1 Pulse and gains enough of an understanding to remove any penalties incurred by using an unfamiliar system. By paying 2 Pulse he gains an indepth understanding of how it works and gains a +2 to any checks to Repair or operate the device. Both uses of this Power last for 3 Rounds, or for the duration of a single extended action e.g. 1 hour of work covered by a single Repair check.</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Heroic, no other Patron God Edges"}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}

After learning their trade in secret lectures at Florida State University, they generally return home to work their farms and build their communities. Bertrand Ruiz was a successful farmer and professor, but he was an adventurer too. That is to say, a few ruizologists take to the road. And when they do, Henry Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture, is very keen to hire wayfaring ruizologists into the United States Department of Agriculture… if the SPA doesn’t recruit them first!</p><p>Ruizologists can come from anywhere in the gamut of backgrounds: a simple farm hand who learned to read and write; an adventurous professor with a whip and a fedora; a graceless boor with a trust fund; or an awkward bookworm with deep-set scruples. Working with other characters, a ruizologist tends to take on the role of an ostentatious problem solver and occasionally a jack-of-all-trades. On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Ruizology</p><p>(Smarts) d4Two spells from the following list of new Powers: Augur, Bolt From The Blue, Rainbow Walk, Refraction Breach, Squall, Weather Working.</p><p>Rain Maker:</p><p>Of course, it’s harder than it looks. Careful preparations and precise calculations must be applied if a ruizologist wishes to effect one of his astounding displays. This isn’t exactly magic. It’s magic and science, and science is easier with the proper tools. Each of a ruizologist’s Powers is enhanced by using a Spell Engine which the ruizologist can activate at any time as part of his spellcasting action. With a Spell Engine, a ruizologist gets +2 to his checks when casting the linked spell, but without one he gets a -2 penalty instead. A superior Engine adds +3 for that particular spell, rather than +2.To build a Spell Engine he’ll need pieces and parts he finds in the local hardware store, costing $10 per point of Pulse the spell uses and needing his Repair Skill to determine success, with a penalty equal to the Pulse the spell uses. Get a Raise, and the Engine is a superior version. This process takes a number of hours equal to the Pulse the spell uses, and a failed Repair check ruins the parts and wastes the time. A character starting out as a ruizologist is assumed to already have Engines for any of his ruizology spells (but not superior versions).</p><p>Ruizologists may still use other spells (ones that aren’t part of his specialization) in the normal manner. Those are still ‘science’ as far as the character is concerned, the precise calculation of Pulse manipulation, but they look and act like magic to everyone else’s thinking.</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Gifted, Repair d8+"}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}

They might never have been, and they certainly aren’t now. There’s no official structure and its members are scattered and isolated. Some would say they haven’t really gone into hiding. It’s just that the more reclusive railwalkers weren’t hunted down. Droop might still be around somewhere, but Hanly is confirmed history. Today, surviving railwalkers are careful to go unnoticed. Even when meeting another of their kind, they check a couple times, maybe tracing a sigil in the air or asking a question about Hanly before invoking the Res ex Gratia.</p><p>On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Invoke Code (Agility) d4</p><p>Two sigils from the following list of new Powers: Bolt The Door, Good Luck, Hidden Stash, Little Slice O’ Heaven, Mean Dog, Worth Robbing.</p><p>Method In The Magic:</p><p>Except as outlined below, the railwalker’s invocation works exactly as any other Scribe check used by an Enabled character (see Savage Suzerain page 36).Commonly scrawled in coal or chalk, sigils are rough icons, with a scant resemblance to their meanings. They were, after all, intended to hide their message, while still bearing a mnemonic element for those in the know. Creating a sigil is simple and yields powerful results, a part of magic that’s also a part of the railwalker in a very physical way. Each sigil strains and the Pulse needs to be wrestled into existence, held and shaped to make the mystical forms that yield the desired results. There are few weak railwalkers; under their rags, they almost all keep the strong, wiry frame of a prizefighter. Not to protect themselves against the bulls (though it’s good for that too), but to shape the magic.</p><p>Invoking the code takes time and physical components. Aside from normal writing utensils, railwalkers can carve, chisel, burn, use a stick in the dirt, pee in the snow, dig a series of trenches, or use just about anything to make a symbol of the proper shape and proportions. The size makes no difference in the sigil’s potency, but larger sigils may draw unwanted attention. Be that as it may, railwalkers sometimes refer to the railroad as ‘The Great Sigil’.</p><p>Sketching a sigil can be done quickly. However, concentrating Pulse to activate it is a more onerous time sink. The process normally lasts a full minute, but can be reduced to a Round by spending twice the normal Pulse. When creating a sigil the slow way, it’s still possible to perform other actions (as long as the character can keep sketching), but the character’s Invoke Code roll will suffer the -2 Multi- Action Penalty. Finishing in a few seconds requires total concentration, and cannot be combined with any other action, speaking, walking, or otherwise. It should also be noted that the extra Pulse spent in doing a quick sketch will recover at the normal rate, although the amount actually needed to fuel the sigil will remain ‘spent’ until the sigil is used up or cancelled. For some sigils that happens immediately the code is invoked (those with an ‘instant’ duration). Others last a short duration, then the sigil’s power is used up. Some have an effect until they’re cancelled… at the will of its creator or by his death!</p><p>Some railwalkers joke that they have a one track mind. It sounds good because of the railroad allusion, but they’re really talking about a quirk of their powers. It is impossible for a railwalker to have more than one instance of the same sigil active at a time. The Hidden Stash sigil and the Worth Robbing sigil work fine together, but inscribing a second Hidden Stash sigil will cancel the effects of the first.</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Enabled, Survival d8+"}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}

Communicating with plants is an automatic action taking one minute of concentration and costing 1 Pulse. Dryads have the ability to telepathically communicate with any sentient plant they are touching, and the ability to increase the intellect of one non-sentient plant he is touching to a state of bare sentience – capable of language but not wit or deep thought.

If this god is your demigod’s chosen patron then prepare for good times, a decent paycheck and more importantly, the trust and friendship of Ra himself. He likes to get personal with his employees and those who shake the sun god’s hand find themselves with perks galore. Ra offers several powers to those who follow him, based on his command of the sun and Hard-light technology. The hero gets one of these abilities when he first takes the Edge, another at Demigod rank. If he takes the Edge when he’s at Demigod rank, he gets two abilities immediately:</p><p><b>Healing Blaze: </b>Down and out, friends dying all around you? Ra can help; this aspect of his Edge will let your demigod burn away hurt like never before. It costs 20 Pulse to activate and takes 4 Rounds to power up. In a Large Burst Template: drive away disease, heal the sick and injured, bring back someone from the brink of death and wipe away pain. Ra’s cleansing sunlight will also remove mental illness from the mind of the afflicted. The hero can choose who in the Large Burst Template is affected by this Power. Everyone affected is cured of any disease or poison they might be suffering from, have the Healing Power cast on them with a Raise, and remove any on-going negative effects they might be subject to, e.g. Stun or Puppet.</p><p><b>Ra’s Generosity: </b>Once per adventure your hero can call on Ra for a favor. It can be a sweet piece of equipment, some soldiers, or another favor entirely. It has to be within the bounds for Ra to grant, not a request he’d consider greedy, and for a purpose he’d approve of — so you can’t ask for a bajillion-squillion dollars to retire and live a life of boundless debauchery, for instance. He might send an attaché case with a cool million in though, if it’ll pay the ransom on one of his favored servants.</p><p><b>Sunburst: </b>Otherwise known as the Vampire Bane, this little trick allows the devotee of Ra to kick in a blast of powerful light. It blinds enemies in a Large Burst Template and drives back evil creatures. It will fry low rank vampires instantly, turning them to dust unless you happen to be in a realm where vampires go out in sunlight. That would be a downer, but some realms are like that. It costs 5 Pulse to activate. Place the Large Burst Template on the hero and everyone touched who doesn’t have Ra as their Patron God takes Damage: 2d6 and is affected by the Blind Power cast with a Raise. Creatures with the Ethereal or Undead Abilities take Damage: 2d8 instead, unless they have special rules that say otherwise (Savage Worlds vampires take Damage: 2d10).

Traditionally on Athens, Logician children are bought from the parents at the age of eight or nine by the polis and sent to train on Thasos at the famous academy for Logicians. Wealthy or sentimental parents might keep the child, and raise it on their own, with all the problems that might incur due to their poor social skills. Contrary to common prejudice, every Logician is a unique individual with their own personality, though it might be difficult for some to see through the peculiarities that make them Logicians.</p><p>All Logicians share the following abilities and limitations:</p><p>EIDETIC MEMORY</p><p>The level of detail with which Logicians remember is such that it can hinder them functioning in society unless their abilities are properly trained and mastered. A normal person might be able to describe all the contents of a room he visited an hour ago. A Logician would be able to describe all contents of the room, down to the number of tiles in the floor. Unfortunately, such a level of detail sometimes clouds the mind of less-trained Logicians, so the GM may demand a Smarts check to remember something important other than the exact number of tiles in the floor. Sometimes the question is whether the Logician noticed a piece of information or a detail, in which case a Notice roll might be more relevant. This ability also gives the Logician the same ability as the Edge Jack-of-all-Trades.</p><p>PERFECT TIMING</p><p>This ability, though often overlooked, is perhaps the most supernatural. Logicians never lose track of time. Their internal biological watch is perfect down to the micro-second, far beyond what their physique is able to take advantage of. Since time is relative and can be affected by gravity and speed, the Logician sometimes needs to adjust his time to local conditions. This ability is not affected by the physical or the mental state of the Logician. In one famous instance, a Logician woke up after a five year coma, and was able to tell the date and time precisely! This ability is most important in connection with astronavigation, and can also been used as an important part of coordinating large scale maneuvers in battles. It can also be a natural alarm clock.</p><p>LIGHTNING CALCULATOR</p><p>This is the ability that has given Logicians their name. Systematic and logical thought is the very essence of Logicians, and nothing is more pure and systematic than basic mathematics. If the GM feels it is necessary to have the Logician make a roll to solve a mathematical problem it is done with a +4 bonus and is resolved instantaneously. Failure should be explained by a lack of facts or numbers, since keeping score of even billions of different numbers is child’s play to the Logician mind. Only higher levels of abstract mathematics or complicated statistics will sometimes distract a Logician, but they still get their +4 bonus.</p><p>NO SENSE OF HUMOR</p><p>The Logician gains the Hindrance of the same name. Note that two Logicians talking together do not suffer -2 Charisma towards each other due to this Hindrance, though they still can’t tell a decent joke.</p><p>TRUTHFUL</p><p>The Logician gains the Hindrance of the same name. Note that if the GM allows it, the Logician may “downgrade” this Hindrance to Big Mouth by using an Advance.</p><p>SOCIALLY INEPT</p><p>Logicians can never take the following skills: Taunt, Streetwise or Persuasion. Nor can they take any Edges which would require social skills or empathy, such as most Leadership Edges and many professional Edges. But that is a small price to pay for mental superiority, right?</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Novice, Smarts d10+, Vigor d6+"}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}

It certainly holds true in most cases. Any enchanter who leaves the comforts of home behind, forsaking his classes and studies, is usually looking for either new knowledge or practical experience. On the other hand, it’s not unknown for some unlucky enchanter to be assigned a guild mission in some little-known, out-of-the-way place where he’s forced to learn how to survive outside of the halls in which he have spent so much time. The only good news for him is how much those locals are likely to value the enchanter's craft.</p><p>Upon taking this Edge, your adventurer receives the Enchanting (Smarts) Skill at d4 and two of the following sigils: Compotis Foraminis, Gradior Conflare, Particeps Fabula, Procul Aspectus, Signum Accendo, Transigo Arma</p><p>Tokens:</p><p>An enchanter's craft is largely accomplished through the use of tokens – items bearing a sigil that can be released at a later time. In order to make a token, an enchanter must take an item and spend 10 minutes per point of Pulse being invested in the sigil to complete the process of binding power to the item. While the Pulse invested in a token regenerates normally, there is a theoretical limit to how many he can have at a given time.Each enchanter is taught how to craft a special pouch for holding tokens. As long as a token remains in the pouch, its power won't degrade – but once removed, it begins to lose its enchantment, eventually becoming useless after a number of days equal to the enchanter's Spirit. Additionally, an enchanter's pouch can only hold a number of tokens equal to twice his Smarts, and a single enchanter can only maintain a number of the same type of sigil equal to his Smarts. It takes an Action to pull a token from the pouch, and another to activate it – although both can be done in the same Round if the enchanter makes a successful Agility check (with a -2 penalty if he doesn't have Quick Draw).</p><p>Each token is given a 'command word' for triggering the sigil, and anyone who knows the word for a given token can use it. However, the item used to create the token is consumed and destroyed when it’s activated, causing most enchanters to use stones or other relatively worthless items for their creation.

Its grisly origins have been forgotten by all but a few incredulous historians. And the South has tolerated the Order’s growth and propagation across several states. Naturally, their methods and beliefs have tempered considerably since the days of Toussaint and Tock. Only a very few practice taximancy, and those few are sure to keep it out of sight or obscure the true mainspring of their miraculous clockwork.</p><p>The Order has permanent churches in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, but its preachers, missions, and revivals reach the entire southern United States, as far north as Delaware, and as far west as Texas. Sermons often extol the virtues of self-expression through physical media, such as painting, sculpture, entomological collections, leather tanning, and dissection. And services usually culminate in a sacramental, hands-on healing session, either purely through prayer or occasionally through a taximancer’s well-concealed art.</p><p>The Order believes that selfish greed is the only sin, but that it takes many forms. Be it pride, lust, or wrath, the desire to outgrow your place in God’s creation is always the cause. Redemption comes from prayer, confession, repentance, and art. Although not selfless to the point of self destruction, members of the Order aspire to be humble believers in the miraculous and the divine.</p><p>On taking this Edge, your character gains:</p><p>Taximancy (Spirit) d4</p><p>Two prayers from the following list of new Powers: Blood To Wine, Bondye’s Boon, Drudge, Filial Drudgery, Loa’s Blessing, Purgatory.</p><p>The Spirits That Ride:</p><p>Toussaint was once a priest in Haiti, and carried many of his beliefs into the new religion that he founded with Tock. Bondye is technically the Order’s only god, however there are many lesser gods or local saints, who are known to aid humans on Bondye’s behalf. These saints are called Loa, and their aid is requested whenever a taximancer takes part in the holy process of creation. Which Loa the taximancer prays to depends on what power he wishes to give his creation.Dealing with the Loa is a dangerous pastime, however – especially for those who are grounded in the realm of the physical. While they are not evil, they do have their own motives, and their actions may therefore appear capricious to mortal men. And while they are willing to do a service in return for the chance to drink of some extra Pulse, they may not always wish to play the servant’s role. In fact, ‘riding’ a physical vessel is something that the Loa are fond of doing – that is, share or taking control of a physical vessel for a time, so that they may enjoy interacting with the physical world.</p><p>In game terms what this means is that any time a character rolls a ‘1’ on his Taximancy die, the prayer fails and the Loa rides him for the rest of the scene, becoming a passenger in the character’s body. A little of the Loa’s more extreme personality quirks rub off on the taximancer – till the end of the scene he gains a major psychological Hindrance of the GMs choosing. Whether that’s a phobia, delusion, death wish, or sudden bout of pacifism, it should be something that’s likely to be relevant to that scene.</p>","notes":"","additionalStats":[],"isArcaneBackground":false,"requirements":{"value":"Empowered, Healing d8+"}},"flags":{},"img":"systems/swade/assets/icons/edge.svg","effects":[]}
